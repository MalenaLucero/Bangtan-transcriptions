00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:16,825
We're already at the end of May.
00:00:16,875 --> 00:00:22,440
May is supposed to be a month where you
spend time with other people,
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:27,011
but this year, things were somewhat different.
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:30,225
The weather is getting hotter,
00:00:30,225 --> 00:00:32,500
and staying home may make you feel bored.
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,845
It's time to get excited.
00:00:34,845 --> 00:00:37,705
It's time for honey FM.
00:00:37,705 --> 00:00:41,073
May 30 Saturday Night live with DJ SUGA!
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,503
It's the last Saturday of May.
00:00:50,503 --> 00:00:53,886
Hello, it's DJ SUGA of honey FM 06,13.
00:00:55,073 --> 00:01:00,566
It's been already over a month since I started
this honey FM.
00:01:00,566 --> 00:01:03,812
This is the 6th edition, time really flies.
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,609
The first day I did this show was in April,
and the weather was cool back then.
00:01:08,609 --> 00:01:10,360
Now the weather is getting hotter.
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,098
I heard that the temperature today has reached
28 degrees.
00:01:13,098 --> 00:01:15,662
How are you?
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,462
"Who's today's guest?"
You will know it soon.
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,760
How have you been?
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:28,140
"Please say 'I'll forgive you'." I'll forgive you.
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,860
Wow, already 100,000 listeners.
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,186
"Did you have dinner?" Not yet.
00:01:38,225 --> 00:01:40,949
I'm going to eat after the radio.
00:01:40,949 --> 00:01:43,829
How are you everyone?
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:45,914
"Hello." Hi!
00:01:48,168 --> 00:01:50,654
"I'm taking rest at home." Oh, okay.
00:01:52,595 --> 00:01:54,300
"Taking online classes".
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,775
Yes, online classes these days.
00:01:55,775 --> 00:01:59,201
"I ordered sushi." Nice choice!
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:02,851
Okay, let's wrap up the opening talk,
00:02:02,851 --> 00:02:05,838
and you may all know,
00:02:05,858 --> 00:02:10,872
maybe we should make a segment called
"with a guest".
00:02:10,872 --> 00:02:16,833
We have a guest today.
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,020
Minimies, Tom and Jerry,
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:23,240
Tony Montana and irreplaceable.
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:29,000
I can see the video clips of us two.
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,040
His voice is the envy of everyone.
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,275
I recognize him as the funniest BTS member.
Jimin!
00:02:36,329 --> 00:02:38,580
- Hello, Jimin.
- Hello!
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,807
You're doing a good job, SUGA.
00:02:41,807 --> 00:02:44,930
- Am I like a professional DJ?
- Yes, I like your voice.
00:02:45,264 --> 00:02:50,477
Hello, I'm Jimin who's being recognized as the
funniest BTS member recently.
00:02:50,477 --> 00:02:51,779
Hello, Jimin.
00:02:51,779 --> 00:02:57,649
Please tell ARMYs about how have you been.
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:05,420
First of all, we haven't seen ARMYs
for a long time,
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,552
so we have filmed many contents.
00:03:09,552 --> 00:03:11,536
- Yes.
- And practicing...
00:03:11,536 --> 00:03:13,986
And I also took some rest.
00:03:14,951 --> 00:03:21,959
You know, you and I are called minimies.
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:25,560
Why?
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,380
Maybe it's because of our name.
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,948
- Yes.
- But it's also like...
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,436
because we are not that tall?
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,988
You know why.
00:03:39,988 --> 00:03:43,360
I'm a bit taller than the average height.
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,140
- Me too.
- The Korean average is about 130...
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:49,720
- Somewhere between 173,6 and 173,8.
- Yes.
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,314
But I'm 174cm tall.
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:53,129
I'm the average.
00:03:53,129 --> 00:03:55,298
- Okay.
- It seems like you're ignoring me.
00:03:55,331 --> 00:03:58,397
No, how can I ignore you?
00:03:58,397 --> 00:04:01,682
As far as I know, you are a couple of millimeters
taller than me.
00:04:01,682 --> 00:04:06,117
- You should not be so accurate.
- Yes.
00:04:06,117 --> 00:04:09,870
Okay, we're called minimies.
00:04:10,451 --> 00:04:12,929
- I was told so.
- Okay.
00:04:12,591 --> 00:04:14,980
- I believe that you're doing well.
- Yes.
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:19,872
Why didn't you visit the shooting site of my
music video?
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:23,140
- Were you upset?
- I really looked forward to your visit.
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:27,199
Your visit during the shooting of comeback
trailer gave me a lot of energy.
00:04:28,491 --> 00:04:30,837
Why didn't you come?
00:04:30,858 --> 00:04:35,824
I want you to long for me more actively.
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:40,277
- Did I have to beg?
- Of course.
00:04:40,277 --> 00:04:42,026
- In fact...
- "Don't you want to come"?
00:04:42,026 --> 00:04:45,353
I asked Jin "Do you want to take part in"?
00:04:45,353 --> 00:04:47,052
and then he immediately said "I'd like to"!
00:04:47,077 --> 00:04:53,186
- That was what happened.
- You didn't seem to want me so bad.
00:04:53,186 --> 00:04:56,620
But for personal schedules,
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,320
it's not easy to make a request
because everyone has one's own time.
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,879
You have to come when I have a personal
schedule.
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:07,256
- You have to.
- Do you mean it?
00:05:07,256 --> 00:05:10,347
- I should go because you came once.
- You have to.
00:05:10,815 --> 00:05:16,122
Anyways, fans call Jimin and I minimies.
00:05:17,607 --> 00:05:19,199
Minimies.
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,615
What comes to your mind when you think of
minimies?
00:05:22,615 --> 00:05:25,655
Leave comments, please.
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,941
Comments, please!
00:05:28,941 --> 00:05:32,174
Looking forward to your comments!
Jimin comes to my mind.
00:05:32,292 --> 00:05:37,049
- You should not interrupt others' radio.
- It's so not being sugarcoated.
00:05:37,049 --> 00:05:40,031
- All of a sudden.
- Jimin! I'm handsome!
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,091
What's that!
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:49,417
It was a sudden interruption by RM.
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,640
What were we talking about?
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:56,420
Oh, I asked for comments.
00:05:58,255 --> 00:06:01,780
"Small cuties lol".
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:07,092
As we are not that tall...
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,751
- I believe that's why they call us minimies.
- Yes.
00:06:10,753 --> 00:06:16,160
"Who's Tom between you two? Both of you
seem Jerry".
00:06:18,451 --> 00:06:20,451
Jerry and Jerry.
00:06:20,558 --> 00:06:23,054
I think I'm Tom.
00:06:23,054 --> 00:06:26,341
- You? - Yes. - I think so, too.
I'm Jerry who's smarter.
00:06:26,341 --> 00:06:29,325
- Yes.
- More clever than you are.
00:06:29,334 --> 00:06:34,003
- You are...
- Do you remember "Tom and Jerry"?
00:06:34,003 --> 00:06:36,758
- Have you seen it?
- Of course, when I was little.
00:06:36,758 --> 00:06:40,468
Tom tries really hard to catch Jerry,
00:06:40,635 --> 00:06:47,171
but it doesn't seem to have evil intentions.
00:06:47,171 --> 00:06:49,205
- I realized it after I've grown up.
- Yes.
00:06:49,205 --> 00:06:51,974
- They are friends.
- After I became a grown-up,
00:06:51,974 --> 00:06:54,487
- I felt some affection towards Tom.
- Yes.
00:06:54,487 --> 00:06:57,187
"What's that? Why does it do that"?
00:06:57,635 --> 00:07:02,813
"Maybe it lacks social skills".
00:07:02,813 --> 00:07:05,283
- That's what I thought about Tom.
- Yes.
00:07:05,263 --> 00:07:09,702
Anyways, Tom and Jerry.
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:16,582
Okay, I'm curious of ARMYs thoughts.
00:07:16,582 --> 00:07:22,604
There's a rumor that Jimin acts stronger
to SUGA than to any other members.
00:07:22,604 --> 00:07:24,180
What do you think of this rumor?
00:07:24,219 --> 00:07:25,815
I...
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:31,810
I think that,
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:34,560
I'm fragile recently.
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,238
So I cannot accept that.
00:07:37,238 --> 00:07:38,975
Jimin is fragile!
00:07:38,975 --> 00:07:40,355
- RM is handsome!
- Fragile...
00:07:40,355 --> 00:07:42,872
- Sorry about that stranger's interruption.
- Bye!
00:07:42,872 --> 00:07:45,670
- Take him out.
- It's a huge interruption.
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:48,024
Sorry, let's get back to the topic.
00:07:48,024 --> 00:07:51,743
You know, I had this interview the other day.
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:57,180
I said if I have to take charge in producing a
member's solo track, I would choose Jimin
first.
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,640
If I have to bring a member to a deserted island,
that would also be Jimin.
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,660
That's what I said in an interview.
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,344
You can see that,
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:08,200
you want me so bad.
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:16,467
- I've already mentioned before... - Yes.
00:08:16,467 --> 00:08:19,559
- You know, there's a track "People" in my
mixtape. - Yes.
00:08:19,559 --> 00:08:25,100
I originally worked on that track considering it
as Jimin's solo track.
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:29,015
But that idea was refuted by the agency.
00:08:30,413 --> 00:08:33,677
- Oh, I haven't heard of that story.
- That's why I included it in my mixtape.
00:08:33,677 --> 00:08:37,300
- I had put it aside for a while.
- So what I should do is to go see the producer.
00:08:38,007 --> 00:08:40,660
Well, Pdogg is in charge of that.
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:43,660
- You know, I've been waiting for years.
- Yes, I know.
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:46,900
- I really want to give you a track.
- Give me one.
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,148
I'm really smooth in writing new pieces of
music recently.
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,800
I write one piece of music or two per day.
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,480
- Okay, so I want one of them.
- Okay.
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,664
- Okay.
- I would appreciate if you give one.
00:08:57,664 --> 00:09:01,991
There hasn't been any new image created
in terms of our chemistry since Tony Montana.
00:09:01,991 --> 00:09:04,348
- I look forward to a new one.
- Yes.
00:09:04,348 --> 00:09:07,048
ARMYs are also looking forward to it.
00:09:07,048 --> 00:09:09,548
I believe there will be another one
someday.
00:09:09,548 --> 00:09:11,384
- Anyways, Jimin.
- Yes.
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:14,058
Do you know about segments of the honey FM?
00:09:14,058 --> 00:09:15,390
I know.
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:19,254
- Tell me.
- I know that there's a segment where we
read a story.
00:09:19,254 --> 00:09:21,171
Yes, yes.
00:09:21,196 --> 00:09:24,183
I look forward to your storytelling.
00:09:24,183 --> 00:09:27,472
Today's story is "The Ant and The Grasshopper".
00:09:27,472 --> 00:09:31,780
- Okay. - I believe many would wonder
who will play the role of ant and the grasshopper.
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:35,160
- Yes. - I recall that "Yongpeureun" you acted.
00:09:35,526 --> 00:09:40,956
I'm no longer that person I used to be.
00:09:40,956 --> 00:09:42,809
- Oh, does that mean that you've grown since
then? - Of course.
00:09:42,809 --> 00:09:46,267
- Oh, grown since then. - Of course.
- And you've become a better actor. - Yes.
00:09:46,267 --> 00:09:50,676
Okay, Jimin, please introduce characters.
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,700
Okay, first of all...
00:09:56,385 --> 00:09:58,765
"The Ant and The Grasshopper".
00:10:00,185 --> 00:10:04,245
SUGA: narration, ant, and squirrel.
00:10:04,245 --> 00:10:07,380
Jimin: grasshopper, queen ant.
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,800
"Once upon a time in the summertime",
00:10:11,267 --> 00:10:14,767
"In the woods, home to many animals",
00:10:14,767 --> 00:10:18,675
"there were so many foods for birds and insects".
00:10:18,675 --> 00:10:22,180
"A lazy grasshopper began another
ordinary day".
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:28,120
"It played the violin and sang a song
while eating foods around it".
00:10:28,745 --> 00:10:33,180
"I'm the grasshopper, it's a peaceful
summer day".
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:37,740
"I'm enjoying the life".
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:41,160
"So beautiful".
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,480
"I'm playing my violin".
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,405
"It's the only lyrics I have, but I'm still
happy".
00:10:50,405 --> 00:10:54,200
"As soon as it finished singing, it heard this sound,
and tried to catch the sound".
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,470
"To see who's making the sound",
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:59,780
"The grasshopper jumped onto a tree".
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:03,670
"Surprisingly, what it saw was a group of ants".
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:08,175
"The ants were trying hard to",
00:11:08,175 --> 00:11:10,380
"move seeds from trees and dry fruits".
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,320
"The grasshopper was surprised",
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,820
"and came down from the tree to see
the ants disappear".
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:20,260
"Ants always work hard".
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:23,570
"I would not work that hard".
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:27,100
"That's when an ant approached the
grasshopper".
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:31,140
"The ant was trying to move a seed that's
way bigger than its body".
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:34,480
"Hey, ant"!
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:42,080
"Why are you trying to move that seed"?
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,820
"Are you trying to move to another place"?
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:50,970
- "No." - "Are you trying to flee because
there's this disaster coming"?
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:53,670
"No way"!
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:56,615
"Then why are you doing that"?
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:59,825
"I'm collecting foods".
00:11:59,825 --> 00:12:04,820
"Oh, okay. You must have some guests tonight".
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:08,575
"No, we're collecting foods to get through
the winter".
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,240
"To get through the winter? Why"?
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,925
"Why are you in such rush"?
00:12:15,925 --> 00:12:19,680
"It's long before the winter. You should
enjoy your life".
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,945
"We're still in the middle of summer".
00:12:21,945 --> 00:12:25,960
"Is there anything you can do in winter"?
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:30,925
"Maybe there're many things I can do.
I'm not worried at all".
00:12:30,925 --> 00:12:32,860
"Okay, you're just thinking of enjoying
your life".
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:36,420
"What I wanted to ask is where would you get
foods in winter"?
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:40,905
"It's winter. I don't have to think of that
in advance".
00:12:40,905 --> 00:12:44,285
"There are so many foods around me".
00:12:44,285 --> 00:12:47,140
"Okay, go sing a song".
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:49,280
"I should follow my fellow ants".
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:52,280
"Can you put this seed on my back"?
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,660
"I'm an artist".
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,385
"So I cannot hold such a heavy thing".
00:12:57,385 --> 00:13:00,615
"That might hurt my neck".
00:13:00,615 --> 00:13:07,680
"The ant started to make efforts to put the
seed onto its back".
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:12,935
"Poor ant, I should give it a helping hand".
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,080
"The grasshopper put the huge seed onto
the ant's back".
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:21,800
"The ant said thank you to the grasshopper
and left".
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,500
"What the ant is doing it pointless".
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,120
"Let me just sing a song".
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,695
"Joyful summertime".
00:13:31,695 --> 00:13:38,005
"I don't remember the rest of the lyrics".
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,130
"That was when a squirrel showed up".
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,400
"Stop it! Stop it"!
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,215
"Can you find another place where you can sing"?
00:13:48,215 --> 00:13:50,470
"I want to take some rest".
00:13:51,035 --> 00:13:53,535
"The grasshopper stopped singing",
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:57,960
"gave a glance to the squirrel and stood up
holding its violin hard".
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:03,310
"There's no insect that enjoys arts in this forest".
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:09,635
"I'll keep singing. It's a happy summertime".
00:14:09,635 --> 00:14:12,405
"I'm the grasshopper"!
00:14:12,405 --> 00:14:14,900
"Even in the hottest summertime",
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,775
"the ant continued to move foods".
00:14:17,775 --> 00:14:22,680
"In the meantime, the grasshopper enjoyed its
life, sang songs and played the violin".
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,860
"The winter came".
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:29,400
"The winds got cold and snow fell down".
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,570
"I'm hungry and cold".
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:36,510
"I'm dying".
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:41,580
"The grasshopper tried to find something
to eat in snow. It was so hungry that it could
barely walk".
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:45,040
"It recalled the scorching summertime".
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,760
"I was really happy then".
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:52,460
"There were so many foods around me".
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:55,555
"I was always full and happy".
00:14:55,555 --> 00:14:58,890
"And the memory reminded it of the ant".
00:15:00,045 --> 00:15:04,900
"I should ask for help to the ant".
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:08,860
"It went to the ant's nest and shouted".
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:16,940
"Help me"!
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,440
"Who are you"?
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:22,175
"Hey, ant! I'm the grasshopper".
00:15:22,175 --> 00:15:24,660
"Can you let me in"?
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,980
"The queen ant asked other ants".
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:32,530
"What's going on? Who's there"?
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,475
The grasshopper and the queen ant have
the same voice.
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,430
"It's the lazy grasshopper that used to spend
time singing".
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:44,020
"Maybe it's here because of hunger".
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:49,960
"We cannot just kick hungry animals out of here".
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,720
"Let's let it in".
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:56,370
"Ants let the grasshopper into their nest".
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:59,600
"Ants got water and foods to the grasshopper".
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,300
"The grasshopper was so grateful".
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:07,620
"I know I should be ashamed".
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:13,280
"I just sang songs while you were working hard
through summertime".
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:16,300
"I barely listened to you advice".
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,620
"It's so regretful".
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,820
"I believe that you've got a lesson".
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:25,120
"We also wanted to enjoy our life,
but we chose to be prepared for the winter".
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:30,475
"We might have to go through difficult times
if we didn't collect foods through the summer".
00:16:30,475 --> 00:16:34,080
"I didn't know that".
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:38,515
"Stay at our nest for a while and get well".
00:16:38,515 --> 00:16:40,720
"Thank you, ants".
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,865
"The grasshopper stayed at the nest for a while".
00:16:43,865 --> 00:16:46,370
"It got well and became healthy".
00:16:47,055 --> 00:16:49,260
"Thank you so much".
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,345
"You saved me, I'll never forget it".
00:16:51,785 --> 00:16:53,870
This is supposed to yours.
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:59,890
It's yours, sorry.
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,825
It's yours.
00:17:02,825 --> 00:17:04,695
- Once again.
- Okay.
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:09,285
"Thank you so much. You saved me. I will
never forget it".
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:15,940
"Okay, let's work hard together next year".
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:18,300
"Okay, don't worry, ants".
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,960
"I'm no longer a lazy grasshopper".
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:25,080
"The grasshopper reflected on its lazy past",
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:29,910
"worked hard to get through the winter,
and lived happily-ever-after".
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:40,360
Jimin, I thought you were a grasshopper
because you sang that grasshopper song
so well.
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,780
- Did you like it?
- Park grasshopper.
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:47,185
I know, I'm like a grasshopper.
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:50,950
Did you remember this story?
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:54,305
I think my memory has been distorted.
00:17:54,305 --> 00:17:57,740
- What...
- I thought that the grasshopper would never
work.
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:01,425
I thought it would end up dying of hunger.
00:18:01,425 --> 00:18:04,870
- There may be different endings.
- Yes.
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:10,380
Depending on a publishing house
or there may be some different editions.
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:16,425
Yes, I thought that the grasshopper repeated
this behavior several times.
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:23,545
Okay, such hardworking ants.
They even work hard in summertime.
00:18:23,545 --> 00:18:27,230
I didn't know that this grasshopper is
this insect.
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:31,900
I didn't know that.
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,040
Oh really?
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:38,520
- I didn't know that. I just considered
it as a character. - Yes.
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:42,015
A grasshopper playing the violin.
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:46,385
If it were today,
00:18:46,385 --> 00:18:51,175
you can film a video of it and upload
the clip on Youtube, then I'm sure
it will be so popular.
00:18:51,175 --> 00:18:54,940
- It even sings. - What do you think of my
voice compared to when I played
Yongpeureun?
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:58,665
I liked it, but it was a bit too much.
00:18:58,665 --> 00:19:01,060
- Too much?
- First off,
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:04,230
you should have analyzed the character
more profoundly.
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:08,300
- The voices of the queen ant and the
grasshopper were...
- Listen to me.
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,135
- I had some problems with this concept.
- Okay.
00:19:10,135 --> 00:19:12,835
- The queen ant...
- Why do you still talk with that voice?
00:19:12,835 --> 00:19:17,265
- I was confused between the two
characters. - The grasshopper.
- I changed my voice to act the queen ant.
00:19:17,265 --> 00:19:21,640
But I realized that it was the grasshopper's
line, not the queen ant's.
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,910
I tried hard to make an accurate analysis.
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:28,540
But I look forward to making a better
voice if there's a good occasion.
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:33,425
Actually, each story has its own lesson to deliver.
00:19:33,425 --> 00:19:35,600
This one...
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:40,660
- Maybe it has a universal lesson. - Yes.
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,800
Hardworking will...
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:49,780
Okay, Jimin's grasshopper song was so impressive.
Why are you laughing?
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:53,975
- Nothing. - Why?
- Because you didn't finish your sentence.
00:19:53,975 --> 00:19:55,635
Just hardworking.
00:19:57,925 --> 00:20:03,910
- It was... about hardworking.
- Yes, each person can get one's own lesson
out of it.
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:08,430
Okay, it's the wrap-up of "Read it with your voice".
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:11,910
You know that there's another regular segment
in the honey FM, don't you?
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,325
Of course, I do.
00:20:13,325 --> 00:20:16,240
Do you know what was the last week's
segment?
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,330
- I couldn't listen to that episode, sorry.
- Okay.
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:22,940
Okay, there's this customized...
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:25,000
- So mean.
- Why?
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,310
- Why are you doing that?
- I understand that you don't know it.
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:29,815
I just said "Okay".
00:20:29,815 --> 00:20:32,430
I didn't see this question in the script.
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:37,240
This week, for Jimin,
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,925
we have a segment where we can get new
information.
00:20:40,925 --> 00:20:43,640
- Quiz on newly-coined expressions.
- Oh, newly-coined expressions?
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,380
Jimin, you're the funniest BTS member,
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:52,995
and in order for you to become the funniest
person in the world, you should get familiar with
these expressions.
00:20:52,995 --> 00:20:55,140
That's why we made this segment.
00:20:55,140 --> 00:21:00,840
Okay, so are you already familiar with these
expressions?
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,235
No, I'm not familiar with them.
00:21:02,235 --> 00:21:04,385
- Me neither.
- Oh, you don't know them either.
- No.
00:21:04,385 --> 00:21:08,240
- Anyways, we have 25 quizzes.
- Okay.
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,391
ARMY, you can write down your own answers,
00:21:11,391 --> 00:21:15,681
and get familiar with newly-coined expressions.
00:21:15,681 --> 00:21:17,211
- Okay.
- To be honest, I'm not really familiar
with those newly-coined expressions.
00:21:17,211 --> 00:21:21,116
- You know, in sauna...
- I remember that we played similar game.
00:21:21,116 --> 00:21:23,136
Yes, back then I...
00:21:23,136 --> 00:21:25,956
I believe you all remember.
00:21:25,956 --> 00:21:30,201
We are given two sheets of A4-sized paper,
00:21:30,201 --> 00:21:33,920
and there are 25 expressions.
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:38,460
Okay, please bring a sheet of paper
and a pen.
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:41,680
Let's read some comments.
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,360
I hardly know one of them.
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,980
Oh my god... me too.
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:50,115
Maybe several...
"Jimin, you're not familiar with these expressions
at all".
00:21:50,115 --> 00:21:51,555
- Someone says that.
- First of all...
00:21:51,555 --> 00:21:53,710
I believe everyone knows that,
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:56,440
but I'm going to try my best.
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:01,800
Okay, let's get started.
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,860
The first one, Ohjeochigo.
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,300
Ohjeochigo.
00:22:07,325 --> 00:22:09,960
- What does this mean?
- I have no idea what it means.
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,025
It must be an abbreviation.
00:22:12,025 --> 00:22:13,657
Yes, I believe so.
00:22:13,657 --> 00:22:15,252
Ohjeochigo.
00:22:15,252 --> 00:22:16,662
Today...
00:22:18,167 --> 00:22:22,360
- Oh, I think I got it!
- Oh, me too! - Today!
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,600
Okay, okay! The 2nd one.
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,765
Gaptongal.
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:31,090
Gaptongal?
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:34,760
Things like muscles come to my mind.
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:38,020
- Gap.. okay.
- I believe we're thinking about the same thing.
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,680
I'm doing a good job.
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,960
What does this mean? Tong?
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:49,020
- No.
- I think I got it.
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,040
Okay! Okay!
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:59,345
I have no idea at all.
00:22:59,345 --> 00:23:04,700
- Tong? Gap?
- Let's move on.
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,800
You can come back to it later.
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,545
Next! Boksepyunsal.
Oh, didn't we guess this one before?
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:14,600
Oh, I remember we did!
00:23:15,585 --> 00:23:19,730
- Muscles in ab...
- No, no.
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:25,860
I have no idea what "bok" stands for.
00:23:28,535 --> 00:23:30,075
Okay, okay, okay.
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:34,280
Okay, I got it.
You know, we did it in that sauna.
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,900
I believe we did.
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:39,500
Okay, the next one is Eumgeunjin.
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,820
- I got it.
- Okay, I got it.
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:52,115
I know this one. I'm 20-something.
00:23:52,115 --> 00:23:53,550
The fifth one.
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:55,619
- Seulsegwon, what's this?
- Seulsegwon.
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,860
What is this?
00:24:00,464 --> 00:24:02,186
Is it something similar to Yeoksegwon,
meaning an area close to a subway station?
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,900
No, it might not be like that.
00:24:08,085 --> 00:24:09,485
Seul...
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:14,970
Okay, okay.
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,700
Gwon...
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,260
Boxing?
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:31,140
Next, Euljukah.
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,530
I know the answer.
00:24:33,355 --> 00:24:35,800
- We did this back then.
- Did we? - Yes.
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:39,445
Face... Not this one.
00:24:39,445 --> 00:24:42,615
Eul...
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:49,490
Wow, do people use these expressions?
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:53,380
The seventh one.
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:56,260
Manbanjalbu.
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,800
Manbanjalbu.
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,340
- Manbanjalbu?
- What's this?
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,835
The cover is so shiny, put it on that cover.
(Korean pun)
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:11,680
Wait, manbanjalbu.
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,640
Oh, I got it!
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:24,140
The theme song of "Bbo bbo bbo"
comes to my mind.
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,160
Don't you?
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:32,385
- "Nice to see you!" like this.
- Nice to see you so let's break things up?
(Korean pun)
00:25:32,385 --> 00:25:34,195
What do you break up?
00:25:35,324 --> 00:25:37,004
- I have no idea.
- Nice to see you...
00:25:37,004 --> 00:25:39,902
Pass! I'll come back to it later.
00:25:40,615 --> 00:25:43,980
- I have no idea.
- The 8th quiz. - Do they really use these
expressions?
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,505
Ohnolahnom.
00:25:46,505 --> 00:25:49,545
- Ohnolahnom.
- Doesn't it mean that you would not come
today?
00:25:49,545 --> 00:25:52,200
- Ohnolahnom.
- It must start with Oh.
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,250
- Today.
- Today.
00:25:58,475 --> 00:25:59,825
Nol?
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:09,015
- Wow, I can barely guess it.
- Today, we're going to spend time...
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,220
I have no idea, pass!
00:26:18,855 --> 00:26:21,865
Okay, next. Sappageoah.
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:26,260
- I've never heard of it.
- Do they really use this?
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:31,450
- Why do they have to use these expressions
once there are some easier ones?
- I've never heard of it.
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:34,280
But I can feel how it means...
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,040
Sappa...
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,840
I think I really got it.
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:44,040
I'm a bit confident with it.
00:26:46,455 --> 00:26:49,010
- Did you write something?
- I think I got it.
00:26:50,405 --> 00:26:54,925
- Byuldajul. - I know this.
- Oh, this one. - This is what we want to say right
now. - Yes.
00:26:54,925 --> 00:26:56,830
You make abbreviations for everything!
00:26:57,670 --> 00:26:59,475
We know the answer.
00:26:59,475 --> 00:27:02,315
I'm good at making a three-line poem.
00:27:02,315 --> 00:27:04,595
And I can take these as comedy opportunities.
00:27:04,595 --> 00:27:06,928
Okay, jeotjalssa. I know this.
00:27:06,928 --> 00:27:07,989
I know the answer.
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,635
I know things like this.
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:20,460
These expressions were popular on the Internet
before I stopped being interested in it.
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,830
Bobae?
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,305
Bobae?
00:27:26,125 --> 00:27:29,250
Doesn't it mean treasures in the ocean?
Is it so old-fashioned?
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,680
Okay, I got it.
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:49,680
Next. Fanahjeo, what's this?
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,530
Fanahjeo.
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:58,315
I got it immediately.
00:27:58,315 --> 00:28:01,580
Fan...
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,900
You haven't got the answer.
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,680
- Give me a second.
- Do you want me, the grasshopper, to sing
a song for you?
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,770
Okay,
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:15,115
- after skimming through all the quizzes...
- Yes.
00:28:15,115 --> 00:28:16,145
Let's come back to them after that.
00:28:16,145 --> 00:28:20,005
- Yes, about 5 minutes.
- The 14th one. Gguanggu, what's this?
00:28:20,005 --> 00:28:22,115
Bend, not bend, bend again? (Korean pun)
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,855
Bend?
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:33,080
- I just pronounced it in my own way.
- Ggu...
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,345
Ggu...
00:28:34,345 --> 00:28:36,400
Ggu ggu...
00:28:37,203 --> 00:28:39,978
Stop it! It was like PPL.
00:28:39,978 --> 00:28:41,573
Don't do that.
00:28:41,573 --> 00:28:44,993
- Nothing comes to my mind.
- We don't have any PPLs.
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:48,485
Okay, okay.
00:28:48,485 --> 00:28:50,030
Okay, okay.
00:28:50,518 --> 00:28:53,253
Okay, okay!
00:28:58,863 --> 00:29:01,660
- The 15th one.
- Okay.
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:04,090
- 15th. Loomgok.
- It's Lomgok.
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:07,425
- Oh, Lomgok? Lomgok. I think I know this.
- What!
00:29:07,425 --> 00:29:09,425
- This is...
- I'm sure I got it.
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:12,720
Isn't it something similar to
the relationship between bear and door.
(Korean pun)
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,015
- Oh, you got the same answer.
- Yes.
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,090
Aljalttakkalsen.
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:23,870
- What...
- It's a non-sense! You must have made it up.
They cannot use this expression.
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:25,625
Aljalttakkalsen?
00:29:26,343 --> 00:29:28,203
You shouldn't use such an expression.
00:29:28,203 --> 00:29:30,959
King Sejong will be so sad.
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:33,400
What's this...
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:36,640
- You shouldn't use such an expression.
You can get scolded at by teachers.
- But...
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,820
- You know, languages change with time.
- Yes.
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:43,575
It's just natural.
You know, when we were little...
00:29:43,575 --> 00:29:47,520
- There used to be buzzwords like yeopgi.
- Yes, I know.
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:51,060
These expressions have been registered on
dictionaries.
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:53,340
They used to be newly-coined back then.
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:55,795
And when I was little,
00:29:55,795 --> 00:29:59,195
many people like to separate vowels from
consonants.
00:29:59,195 --> 00:30:03,470
To take "man" as an example, they used to
write it separately like "m a n".
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,240
- Okay.
- Wasn't there something called
"goblin language"?
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,640
- Pronouncing words from the end.
- Yes.
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,360
Those Internet users...
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:13,175
- They used to use that kind of language.
- Yes, until early 2000s.
00:30:13,175 --> 00:30:15,445
But I'm not so familiar with that either
because I don't enjoy Internet communities.
00:30:15,445 --> 00:30:18,785
- When I was little I just...
- Aljalttakkalsen.
00:30:18,785 --> 00:30:20,420
I have no idea at all.
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,781
Let's just move on.
00:30:23,061 --> 00:30:26,204
- Abara abara.
- Look at him.
00:30:26,204 --> 00:30:27,767
Abara.
00:30:29,255 --> 00:30:30,538
Earlier...
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:41,940
I'm not sure I'm allowed to write this.
00:30:43,035 --> 00:30:45,945
The movie "The War of Flower" comes to my
mind.
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,720
That's Asurabalbalta.
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,840
Asurabalbalta.
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:54,920
- Oh, Abara for that?
- Maybe foreigners who really like that movie...
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,970
Asurabalbalta.
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:58,775
Asurabalbalta.
00:30:58,775 --> 00:31:01,495
- Then Abara?
- Yes, Asurabalbalta to Abara.
00:31:03,865 --> 00:31:07,940
Next, the 18th one, Beocachoong.
I know the answer for this. We did this.
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,220
Beocachoong?
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:13,925
Something comes to my mind.
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:18,840
Next.
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,545
- Jjeojuktta.
- Jjeojuktta.
00:31:22,545 --> 00:31:25,145
- Isn't it about dying of heat?
- Jjeojuktta.
00:31:25,145 --> 00:31:27,000
I'm dying of heat.
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,446
- Tta?
- This is...
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,380
It has a different pronunciation.
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:34,965
- I know that!
- Okay.
00:31:35,155 --> 00:31:37,790
It's Jjeojuktta.
00:31:38,785 --> 00:31:40,800
What's this?
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:44,415
Wow, do they really use these expressions?
00:31:48,862 --> 00:31:51,980
- Jjeojuktta.
- I have no idea at all.
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:12,610
Okay, the next one is Wolabel.
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,640
- Wolabel.
- What does this mean?
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,600
Wolabel.
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,535
Bel...
00:32:26,535 --> 00:32:29,665
It may refer to "balance".
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:38,240
Ramen and Kimchi...
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,560
I have no idea.
00:32:41,535 --> 00:32:43,510
I'm not sure.
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:46,880
- The next one.
- Fans are giving clues.
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,000
They say "Worldwide belbelbel".
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:57,920
Next!
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:01,160
The next one is Seurabel.
What's this?
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,110
Please give us a clue, everyone!
00:33:07,715 --> 00:33:10,760
Even if you pass by...
00:33:12,065 --> 00:33:14,220
I guess this also is about balance.
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:17,940
Funny.
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:22,310
- What does this Seurabel mean?
- Let's move on.
00:33:25,025 --> 00:33:30,335
The next one was coined by Jung Kook.
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,410
- Apobangpo.
- Oh!
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:34,975
I think I know this.
00:33:35,923 --> 00:33:37,760
It was coined by Jung Kook.
00:33:41,865 --> 00:33:43,360
- I got it.
- Yes.
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,555
I believe every BTS member knows this.
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:48,615
Something comes to mind as soon as I heard that
this was coined by Jung Kook.
00:33:48,615 --> 00:33:50,509
Jung Kook uses many pretty expressions.
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:55,105
- The 21st one.
- Amuhaengal. Oh, I think I know it.
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:59,720
Okay, I'll try to get it.
00:34:00,285 --> 00:34:03,095
Why do they make such an abbreviation?
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,090
- What's next? Jungbaechuhae?
- Jungbaechuhae?
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:14,935
Jung Kook!
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:18,845
Jung Hoseok, I baechu you.
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,500
Hey, Jung Kook!
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:25,945
Given that it was coined by Jung Kook,
Jung may stand for Jung Kook,
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,340
and bae...
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,280
Okay, I wrote something.
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,400
The next one is Yeokjipjaman.
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,080
Yeokjipjaman.
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,780
- Do they really use this expression?
- I knew...
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,460
Jip...
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:02,620
No way.
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,620
I got it.
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:09,680
Worabel. Worldwide belbelbel.
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:13,920
Worabel.
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:19,200
- Worabel.
- I have no idea what Worabel and Seurabel
stand for.
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,340
Do they really use these expressions?
00:35:24,385 --> 00:35:26,880
- You know what...
- Oh, I got it!
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:37,670
Okay!
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,780
Seurabel?
00:35:50,625 --> 00:35:53,100
What are the words that begin with seu?
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,220
Ski, skating...
00:35:56,485 --> 00:36:00,620
Seu...
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,100
Oh, is it an abbreviation of an English phrase?
00:36:12,495 --> 00:36:14,935
- I have no idea.
- Mine is an English phrase.
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:22,380
I think I read this Worabel from articles.
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,540
Do we use "jjeo"?
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:41,360
What are the foods that can be boiled?
(Korean pun)
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:45,120
Okay, I'm done.
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,460
Let's grade our answer sheets.
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:51,340
Let's see the answers. From the first quiz.
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,020
I think I got this one.
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:58,840
- The answer for Ojeochigo!
- Yes.
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:01,000
SUGA, what's your answer?
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,270
Let's eat fried chicken tonight.
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:04,010
- Really?
- Yes.
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:06,729
I wrote, how about after dinner?
00:37:06,729 --> 00:37:10,224
- I've never heard of it before.
- Still it was close.
00:37:10,224 --> 00:37:11,524
Me neither.
00:37:11,524 --> 00:37:13,479
But this came to my mind.
00:37:13,479 --> 00:37:14,781
Gaptongal?
00:37:14,781 --> 00:37:17,680
- SUGA, what was yours?
- It means I saw my bank balance and
realized I need a part-time job.
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,880
It's...
00:37:22,335 --> 00:37:23,620
- Hey!
- What was your answer?
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:25,600
I suddenly want to know about the curfew.
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,305
Mine is, I suddenly gained weights.
00:37:29,265 --> 00:37:34,260
Do they use this expression for this sentence?
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:36,720
Stop lying! Do they really use this expression?
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,810
I have no idea.
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:43,105
- Too difficult. How about Boksepyunsal?
- I think we did it before.
00:37:43,105 --> 00:37:44,595
Let's live an easy life in this complex world.
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:47,270
Three ab muscles are flipped.
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:51,020
- What are you talking about? Are you trying
to make people laugh? - No!
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:53,385
- It's because I have no idea at all.
- Are you serious?
00:37:53,385 --> 00:37:54,760
What was your answer for Eumgeunjin?
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,840
Very strict and serious.
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,540
The answer is strict serious and heavy.
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:01,815
- It was close, anyways.
- Okay, then you can get a score. - No, it was
still not accurate.
00:38:01,815 --> 00:38:06,580
- What was your answer for Seulsegwon?
- Need to fight for our rights in this society
full of sorrow.
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,280
What? An area where we can reach everywhere
with slippers on?
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:13,040
- I...
- Seul... - Slipper...
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,820
- An area where we can reach everywhere
with slippers on.
- I had no idea at all.
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:18,640
An area where we can reach everywhere
with slippers on.
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:22,745
This was my answer. Sour and sweet.
00:38:22,745 --> 00:38:25,010
You want it?
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:27,680
You can just go everywhere with your slippers
on!
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,680
- I always wear slippers recently.
- Me too.
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:33,840
- Anywhere?
- We have slippers at shooting sites...
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,980
- Yes, to meetings...
- Yes.
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,240
- Outside of that occasion... I wear slippers.
- Me too.
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,745
- What was your answer for Euljukah?
- It's ice americano even in winter.
00:38:41,745 --> 00:38:44,470
We've already seen it in that sauna.
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:46,800
- Oh, ice americano even in winter.
- Yes.
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,540
I wrote, broken hearts.
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:56,545
- I had no idea. - Manbanjalbu. I ended up
with no answer.
00:38:56,545 --> 00:38:59,225
Wow, nice to meet you, my service to you!
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:02,300
You should not say this.
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:06,120
- Manbanjalbu!
- If you say this at your workplace...
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:08,725
- If you say "Manbanjalbu"!
- Well...
00:39:08,725 --> 00:39:10,555
- You should not do that.
- But...
00:39:10,555 --> 00:39:15,200
Later, this expression could become so widely
used.
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,795
Do you really expect that?
00:39:17,795 --> 00:39:19,410
- Do you?
- Listen to me.
00:39:19,435 --> 00:39:21,325
This expression, Eumgeunjin,
00:39:21,325 --> 00:39:25,730
has already become a popular word,
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:28,300
to say strict, serious and heavy.
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:32,285
- So you expect it may hold true for
Manbanjalbu? - Maybe. Later.
00:39:32,285 --> 00:39:34,270
Later, people may say
"Hey, director! Manbanjalbu"!
00:39:35,167 --> 00:39:36,587
Not impossible.
00:39:36,587 --> 00:39:40,790
- Ohnolanom. I failed to write a full sentence.
- Ohnolanom.
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:41,940
- I failed to get the answer.
- Today...
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:43,585
Oh, is he someone who knows how to
enjoy his life?
00:39:43,585 --> 00:39:45,765
I wrote, do you want to hang out with me today?
Otherwise, you're bad.
00:39:45,765 --> 00:39:49,180
- This was my answer.
- Does it have to be you're bad unless you hang
out with me today.
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:52,380
Anyways...
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:53,770
- We got the wrong answers.
- Okay.
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:56,155
- Sappajeoah.
- I think I got it.
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:59,296
Here's my answer.
Falling in love cannot be a crime.
00:39:59,321 --> 00:40:02,056
Oh, I wrote the same answer.
00:40:02,056 --> 00:40:05,960
- The answer is... - "It's not a crime to fall in love".
- So we both were wrong.
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:09,490
- Apparently this is a famous line in a drama,
"The World of the Married". - Oh, that drama.
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:10,825
So I got it right.
00:40:11,533 --> 00:40:13,479
- Next, Byeol Da Jul.
- Hang on.
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:16,340
You didn't get it right. You didn't get
the exact words.
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:18,150
They basically mean the same thing.
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:21,260
Then my answer is also right.
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,365
Yeah!
00:40:22,365 --> 00:40:25,140
- It is?
- Yeah, yours also mean the same thing.
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:27,915
Okay then.
We know what Byeol Da Jul is.
00:40:27,915 --> 00:40:29,650
- Yeah. It means "making acronyms for
everything". - Making acronyms.
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:31,820
- Okay.
- Jut Jal Ssa.
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:34,435
- "I lost but it was a good game". Yeah, I knew this.
- Yeah. We know this a least.
00:40:34,435 --> 00:40:37,031
Next, Bo Bae.
I thought it meant "watch and learn".
00:40:37,031 --> 00:40:39,509
We tend to keep up with trends.
00:40:39,509 --> 00:40:41,309
Bo Bae means "portable batteries"?
00:40:41,309 --> 00:40:43,544
It means portable batteries?
00:40:43,544 --> 00:40:45,834
- What did you write?
- "Watch and learn".
00:40:45,862 --> 00:40:47,951
I wrote "There's a pear in a bag".
00:40:47,932 --> 00:40:50,227
What does that mean?
00:40:50,227 --> 00:40:51,915
I don't know.
00:40:51,915 --> 00:40:54,725
- Fan A Jeo. - I have no idea what this means,
so I didn't write anything.
00:40:54,725 --> 00:40:56,980
- Fan...
- I wrote this.
00:40:56,980 --> 00:41:01,060
"I love ARMY among all fandoms".
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:05,210
Okay. According to the answer sheet, it means
"You save it although you're not a fan of them".
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:12,840
- No. 14. Kku An Kku. - I think I know this.
I wrote "putting some makeup but not much".
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,610
That's the right answer. I didn't write anything
for this.
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:19,660
- Rom Gok. I know this. It means "tears".
- I...
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:21,565
I actually held the paper upside down
and found this out.
00:41:21,565 --> 00:41:24,045
- So that means "tears".
- So we got that right, and...
00:41:24,045 --> 00:41:29,150
- Al Jal Ddak Kkal San. I really want to know the
answer. - "You should know how to do it".
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:31,840
- That's the answer, really?
- Yeah. I don't like it either.
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:38,780
We can just say it. "You should do how to
do it!". Like this. We don't really have to
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:45,155
- make an acronym for that... It's even hard to
pronounce! - Al Jal Ddak Kkal San.
00:41:45,155 --> 00:41:49,160
- Al Jal Ddak Kkal San! - Hey, Jimin!
Al Jal Ddak Kkal San! So hard to pronounce this.
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:51,960
- People really use this? - I cannot even memorize
the word. It sounds like a foreign language to me.
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:56,235
No.17. A Ba Ra.
My answer was "the radio that I just saw".
00:41:56,235 --> 00:41:58,545
I said, "Asurabalbalta".
00:41:58,545 --> 00:42:00,675
Asurabalbalta!
00:42:00,675 --> 00:42:03,165
Gosh, the answer says it means
"ice vanilla latte".
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:07,155
A lot of words are related to coffee here.
00:42:07,155 --> 00:42:10,625
- I know what A A is. It's an ice Americano.
- I know that one too.
00:42:10,625 --> 00:42:14,540
- I often say, "One A A please".
- Yeah, we say like Tteu A or A A.
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:17,265
Beo Ka Chung. We all know this one.
00:42:17,265 --> 00:42:19,500
- Beo Ka Chung. "Topping up a bus card".
- Topping up a bus card.
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,785
Jju Juk Dda. What did you write for this one?
00:42:21,785 --> 00:42:23,905
I said it means "Going for a hot Americano
even when it's deadly hot".
00:42:25,885 --> 00:42:28,720
- Hot beverage.
- Yeah, you're right.
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,785
- I actually...
- I got this one wrong.
00:42:30,785 --> 00:42:32,835
- The writer gave me a hint, actually.
- I...
00:42:32,835 --> 00:42:34,960
- She said it's the opposite of no.6.
- I have no idea what I wrote for this.
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,367
- Even when it's deadly hot...
- Okay next. Wo La Bal.
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:42,670
Wo La Bal. I wrote "Woah, what's important
when you make ramen is the amount of water".
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:44,940
I said, "World Life Balance".
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:47,225
S La Bal. Star Live Balance.
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:52,090
Okay, the answer says Wo La Bal means
"Work Life Balance".
00:42:52,965 --> 00:42:56,405
- It says it's only used in Korea.
- And S La Bal means "Study Life Balance".
00:42:56,405 --> 00:42:58,875
- We both were wrong.
- So balancing your studies and life.
00:42:58,875 --> 00:43:01,875
I wrote "Woah, what's important when you make
ramen is the amount of water" for Wo La Bal.
00:43:02,855 --> 00:43:06,950
That sounds good. "Woah, what's important
when you make ramen is the amount of water"!
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:12,680
And I wrote "What's important when you skate
is balance" for S La Bal. But that was wrong.
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:15,200
And next. What Jung Kook made...
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:19,045
- A Fo Bang Fo. I got this one right. "ARMY Forever
BTS Forever". - Yeah, we know this.
00:43:19,045 --> 00:43:20,525
We all know this.
00:43:20,525 --> 00:43:22,055
Jung Kook mentioned this so many times.
00:43:22,591 --> 00:43:24,236
- A Mu Hang Al. I think I know this one too.
- A Mu Hang Al.
00:43:24,236 --> 00:43:27,366
"ARMY, please be happy. Okay?".
00:43:27,366 --> 00:43:29,626
- Yeah, I got this one right.
- Me too.
00:43:29,626 --> 00:43:31,944
- Jung Bae Chu Hae. What did you write for
this one? - Jung Bae Chu Hae.
00:43:32,548 --> 00:43:36,700
I wrote "Jung Kook's stomach...", but the answer
is "Jung Kook is hungry, any recommendations?".
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:38,420
Is this also made by Jung Kook?
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:39,995
Oh, it's made by ARMYs?
00:43:39,995 --> 00:43:42,715
I wrote "If you're exhausted, you should have
a bite of cabbage".
00:43:44,026 --> 00:43:48,545
I almost got the Jung Bae Chu Hae one right.
00:43:48,545 --> 00:43:50,395
- Is that made by Jung Kook?
- Next.
00:43:50,395 --> 00:43:54,180
- Euk Jip Jam An. "You're not sleepy anymore
when you get home". Oh, I got it right! - Me too.
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:57,900
Yeah, my answer is close enough.
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:01,420
- What did you write?
- "I don't get sleepy at home".
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:03,220
- Yeah, you got it right.
- Right?
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:05,400
Okay, how many did you get right?
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,800
- 1, 2, 3, 4...
- I think I did good enough.
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:11,615
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.
00:44:11,615 --> 00:44:14,290
- I got 14.
- You got 14? - Yeah.
00:44:14,290 --> 00:44:16,610
- 14 out of 25.
- You did so well.
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:18,935
3, 4, 5.
00:44:18,935 --> 00:44:20,275
I got 8.
00:44:22,330 --> 00:44:25,100
- I think I did pretty well.
- Yeah, you did.
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:30,720
I got Jju Juk Dda right, thanks to
the hint that the writer gave to me.
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,160
Otherwise, I couldn't have got it right.
00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:35,860
But people really use these words?
00:44:38,735 --> 00:44:40,540
I'm shocked.
00:44:41,115 --> 00:44:44,445
I'll start using some acronyms from now on.
00:44:44,445 --> 00:44:46,095
Shu Bae.
00:44:46,095 --> 00:44:48,515
- SUGA Grasshopper?
- SUGA is hungry.
00:44:48,515 --> 00:44:49,880
Yeah, I am.
00:44:50,722 --> 00:44:53,176
- A Sa.
- What? - A Sa.
00:44:53,176 --> 00:44:55,056
ARMY, I love you.
00:44:57,410 --> 00:44:59,160
What is this... a telepathy?
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:05,345
So did you like this game?
00:45:05,345 --> 00:45:11,130
- I'm not really used to using many acronyms.
So it was a bit hard. - Yeah.
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:14,340
Well, if people around me start using them,
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:17,820
maybe I'll be using them as well. I think.
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:20,260
Maybe we're not keeping up with the trend.
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:24,205
- If we were a bit younger, it would be easier
to keep up with the trend. - Yeah.
00:45:24,205 --> 00:45:27,840
- But it's okay.
- Or if we used more the Internet...
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:33,375
- But...
- I'm not willing to do so, so...
00:45:33,375 --> 00:45:35,605
You only use the Internet when you play
some games...
00:45:35,605 --> 00:45:38,175
And I asked you about everything
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:40,645
- like how to play the game, and...
- Yeah, you did.
00:45:40,645 --> 00:45:43,920
So... What's your rank in...
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,455
Be quiet.
00:45:46,205 --> 00:45:48,400
- Aren't you a silver?
- Everyone.
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,350
We've been playing the game together
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:55,040
for the past 3 weeks, and he told me
not to breathe while playing the game.
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,850
I didn't tell you that.
FYI, I'm a gold 1.
00:46:00,585 --> 00:46:04,620
Anyway, I had so much fun doing today's show
with you Jimin. What about you?
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:09,480
Well, nowadays...
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:13,190
- We're preparing so many things.
- Yeah.
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:16,240
But we can't see our fans in person.
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,480
So, these days, we don't get a chance to
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,840
see our fans.
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:25,140
- I felt bad about it. But this...
- Yeah.
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:28,580
- This enabled me to talk to our fans, so I was
very happy. - Yeah.
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:30,720
And I've listened to this show
for several times actually.
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,185
I thought your voice sounded so good.
00:46:33,185 --> 00:46:38,360
And I thought I'll be able to do things
pretty well if I get a chance to be here.
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:40,130
So I really had a good time today.
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:42,420
Then you should have a regular content too.
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:45,640
I... Maybe...
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:50,120
- With Jimin...
- Minimis? - No, no.
00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:53,815
- Maybe Modern Dance with Jimin.
- I'm hungry, Minimis...
00:46:53,815 --> 00:46:58,090
- You want to learn how to dance? Minimis?
- I can learn how to dance from you.
00:46:58,090 --> 00:47:02,040
Good! I'm not good enough to teach
how to dance, but...
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:05,695
I can learn from someone else and
try the dance together with you.
00:47:05,695 --> 00:47:07,225
Well, you suggested this first.
You should do it really.
00:47:07,225 --> 00:47:09,580
But I really have thought about it.
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:14,225
- Doing dance practice... - Practice?
- I want to dance better.
00:47:14,225 --> 00:47:16,035
- Really? then for real...
- Yeah.
00:47:16,035 --> 00:47:20,235
- You really want to try?
- Yeah, if we have a chance.
00:47:20,235 --> 00:47:23,985
It doesn't have to be a new dance.
00:47:23,985 --> 00:47:26,820
- Dance... - We can make a cover dance video
or something. - Yeah, doing some covers.
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:29,825
- Good. - We can create new dances too.
00:47:29,825 --> 00:47:32,070
- What?
- We can.
00:47:32,070 --> 00:47:34,110
Okay. How was today's show to you?
00:47:36,275 --> 00:47:41,485
Okay, before I let you go,
we should take a selfie together.
00:47:41,485 --> 00:47:48,580
Jimin. That, that one.
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:51,360
- That...
- Yeah.
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:54,170
- Shall we get ready to take a selfie?
- Yeah.
00:47:54,170 --> 00:47:55,900
- I came here wearing a cap today.
- Yeah.
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:57,823
Let me put it back on, and...
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:03,380
- It's fun. Before, when...
- Yeah. All members loved it too.
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:04,835
- When we did some radio shows...
- Yeah.
00:48:04,835 --> 00:48:08,020
- We were so nervous and couldn't say much.
- Right.
00:48:09,865 --> 00:48:13,480
- We were newbies.
- Right.
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:16,090
- But I really had so much fun today.
- Okay.
00:48:17,306 --> 00:48:22,690
- Jimin, you take the phone. - Yeah?
- You're taking the photo. - Okay.
00:48:27,263 --> 00:48:29,198
I'll take it.
00:48:31,305 --> 00:48:32,745
A selfie of us.
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:34,920
1, 2, 3.
00:48:36,795 --> 00:48:37,955
One more.
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:39,980
1, 2, 3.
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:42,845
One more.
00:48:42,845 --> 00:48:44,965
- Yeah, that.
- Okay, good.
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:47,420
1, 2, 3.
00:48:48,905 --> 00:48:50,580
Okay. Good.
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:54,755
Jimin, now you can say goodbye
00:48:54,755 --> 00:48:59,320
- Everyone, as I've always told you...
- Yeah.
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:01,460
You always say
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:04,640
- a lot of good things about us no matter
what we do. - Yeah.
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:08,045
You send us hearts and support us.
00:49:08,045 --> 00:49:12,400
- Yeah.
- And that makes us do something and work hard
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,800
even in this situation.
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:17,340
- Yeah.
- Thank you for being there for us.
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:20,080
I'll work harder as well.
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:24,300
- Thank you and I love you. - Okay, Jimin.
You can leave now.
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:26,745
- Thank you.
- Get home safe. - Okay.
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:33,060
I'll read some comments now.
00:49:36,190 --> 00:49:40,955
The game was quite fruitful, I guess.
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:47,900
"This is an acronym that I just made.
Bang Sa! It's "I love you, BTS"".
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:49,300
A Sa!
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:53,160
"Don't go, Jimin".
00:49:54,330 --> 00:49:58,580
One said that. And another comment says
"Good bye".
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:00,780
There are purple hearts.
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:07,140
"Your show comforted me today. Thank you".
I thank you.
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:13,540
So, today's Honey FM was joined by Jimin,
whom you all waited for.
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:15,600
So, how was it? Did you have fun?
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,760
Reading your comments,
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,500
I can see that you had fun.
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:24,185
So, we should read what you tweeted after
last week's show now.
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:27,115
"DJ SUGA was so cute".
00:50:27,115 --> 00:50:32,440
"And j-hope who created Daechwita challenge...
It was fun to hear you two talking".
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:35,965
"I laughed so hard for an hour
as I did every week".
00:50:35,965 --> 00:50:39,920
"And I drank one or two glasses of water
after the show".
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:44,620
"I'll endure another week waiting for you,
DJ SUGA. Thank you".
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:47,000
"You've done so well today as well".
00:50:47,775 --> 00:50:51,000
Thank you. Was the show with j-hope that fun?
00:50:52,075 --> 00:50:54,100
"Hwagae Market! Thank you, DJ SUGA".
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:55,850
"I hope j-hope comes to this show more".
00:50:55,850 --> 00:50:59,035
"For the first time since last year's April Fools' Day,
I was nervous that you will really part ways".
00:50:59,035 --> 00:51:00,860
"I wasn't feeling well today. So I was in my bed".
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:03,135
"And your Honey FM made me feel better
right away. Thank you".
00:51:03,135 --> 00:51:05,106
"I'll wait for another Hwagae Market".
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:08,800
"Honey FM is my source of energy these days".
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:14,780
"You sounded more exciting today. Maybe
because there was j-hope. I was excited too".
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:19,200
"I don't want to imagine a Saturday without
Honey FM now. You'll continue doing this, right?".
00:51:22,395 --> 00:51:24,205
Well... Yeah.
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:27,245
I'm not sure, but...
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:31,200
Yeah. I'll keep doing this.
00:51:32,785 --> 00:51:36,455
"After Agust D was released yesterday,
I've been listening to only "Daechwita"".
00:51:36,455 --> 00:51:39,140
"I watched the MV over and over again,
thinking this cannot be the face of a human".
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:41,975
"Thank you for talking to us as DJ SUGA
like this. I love you".
00:51:41,975 --> 00:51:43,870
"You're our source of energy".
00:51:43,870 --> 00:51:47,082
Thank you. Please keep listening to the song.
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,510
"I was touched by today's Honey FM as well".
00:51:50,510 --> 00:51:55,085
"When your first mix tape was released, I was only
a student. But now I'm an adult".
00:51:55,085 --> 00:51:59,545
"From school to home, I listened to "724148". Now
from my office to home, I listen to "Moonlight"".
00:52:01,905 --> 00:52:03,090
Really?
00:52:04,385 --> 00:52:06,495
So it's been 4 years.
00:52:06,495 --> 00:52:11,535
"I became an adult and there's nothing special
about it. But I'm not lonely thanks to you".
00:52:11,535 --> 00:52:15,550
"I love you. Hope to see you at the concert soon".
Everyone's special.
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,460
I think you are too.
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:26,480
"I was so stressed thinking of upcoming
midterm exams".
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:29,885
"But your show and the song "People" gave
me a lot of strength".
00:52:29,910 --> 00:52:31,720
"Thank you and I love you, SUGA".
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:33,695
I thank you.
00:52:34,345 --> 00:52:39,520
"First, "Daechwita" is so good. You always
make my Saturday, DJ SUGA".
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:43,840
"The alert for your show makes me so happy.
Today's show was so fun too".
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:47,490
"It was a hard day, but you made me laugh.
I cannot live without BTS".
00:52:47,490 --> 00:52:49,505
"I'll join the "Daechwita" challenge too".
00:52:49,505 --> 00:52:52,450
I believe you really joined the challenge.
00:52:54,035 --> 00:52:59,685
"I hope your life becomes a bit more special
by the ordinary lives of ARMYs".
00:52:59,685 --> 00:53:03,980
"Thank you for giving me strength and courage,
and thinking about us all the time".
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:07,005
"I'm happy to hear your voices".
00:53:07,005 --> 00:53:08,795
"I'll support you forever".
00:53:08,795 --> 00:53:13,775
You really give us great strength.
00:53:13,775 --> 00:53:16,265
Thanks to you, we're able to
00:53:16,265 --> 00:53:18,605
keep doing our music
00:53:18,605 --> 00:53:21,925
and also this show.
Thank you so much.
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:26,825
"I was looking forward to going to school,
since it's my first year in middle school".
00:53:26,839 --> 00:53:30,911
"But we're taking remote classes now.
I now staying healthy is the best always".
00:53:30,911 --> 00:53:34,001
"But I felt sad. But your radio show".
00:53:34,001 --> 00:53:36,255
"Always comforts me. I'm happy".
00:53:36,255 --> 00:53:38,820
"Thank you, DJ SUGA. I love you".
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:41,465
Yeah, you're taking remote classes right?
00:53:41,465 --> 00:53:43,025
Yeah.
00:53:44,110 --> 00:53:47,370
I cannot imagine how you must be feeling
right now.
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:52,380
But as you said my voice gave you strength,
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:53,785
I'm happy too.
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:59,980
"Feeling happy when it's totally unexpected
makes you feel happier".
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:04,530
"You did your show on Friday last week, and
you released your mix tape out of the blue".
00:54:04,530 --> 00:54:05,675
"Those were some unexpected happiness for me".
00:54:05,675 --> 00:54:09,315
"Listening to your voice and what you do
with the guest makes me happy".
00:54:09,315 --> 00:54:11,955
"And waiting for your show itself makes me
happy as well. So I'm thankful".
00:54:11,955 --> 00:54:17,300
Yeah. Unexpected happiness
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:21,120
makes you even happier.
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:27,690
Thinking that you want to be happy
00:54:27,690 --> 00:54:30,595
can make you unable to feel happy.
00:54:30,595 --> 00:54:34,060
And being one of your
unexpected happy moments
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:36,980
makes me happy.
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:40,920
"Your mix tape already made me so happy, and
your radio just killed me".
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:45,080
"I was having dinner, but I started listening to
the show through my earphones".
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:47,420
"Your show kept me laughing.
You and j-hope had great chemistry".
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:51,675
"Your story telling was so fun to hear as well".
00:54:51,675 --> 00:54:55,370
"I love you, DJ SUGA.
You're a genus!". Thank you.
00:54:59,775 --> 00:55:05,930
So many of you tell me that my show
gives you strength in this time of frustration.
00:55:05,930 --> 00:55:11,025
And that gives me strength and
makes me happy.
00:55:11,025 --> 00:55:15,240
Thank you for your tweets
with various and moving opinions on my show.
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:18,580
Don't forget to tweet about today's show as well.
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:24,660
Today's hashtag is #0613FM_0530.
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:26,480
It's today's date.
00:55:27,165 --> 00:55:30,960
Hashtag #0613FM_0530.
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,860
That's today's date.
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:38,540
I had fun doing today's show, talking to you
on this hot weekend where we're all tired.
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:44,115
I hope this show restored you some energy
that you lost throughout this week.
00:55:54,055 --> 00:55:56,960
When you're with a good friend,
you don't need to say anything.
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:59,920
And you don't feel awkward even when you two
see each other for the first time in a long time.
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:03,740
We're not allowed to see our friends that often
these days.
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:05,880
But if the person is precious to you,
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:08,440
you'd be happy even when seeing him or her
for the first time in a long time.
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:12,805
That'll be the case with BTS and ARMY too.
00:56:12,805 --> 00:56:17,540
We'll be very happy to see each other again.
00:56:18,097 --> 00:56:21,320
ARMYs, you've done a good job today as well.
