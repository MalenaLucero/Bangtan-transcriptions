00:06:34,702 --> 00:06:36,782
- What a relief.
- Right. Bongseonhwa (Garden balsam).
00:06:36,782 --> 00:06:38,277
[Disappointed]
- Come on. - I thought you'd answer that.
00:06:38,277 --> 00:06:40,282
[Please pay attention to Suga]
[No one is listening] Like this.
00:06:40,282 --> 00:06:41,142
[Whisper]
What did you say?
00:06:41,142 --> 00:06:42,550
[Huh? Nothing]
Me? Pyojipan (road sign).
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:44,417
- Did you say Pyojipan (road sign)?
- Pannepyo.
00:06:44,417 --> 00:06:45,900
Pannepyo?
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,148
What does that even mean?
00:06:47,148 --> 00:06:49,558
- Pannepyo?
- Panmepyo (ticket).
00:06:49,558 --> 00:06:52,050
Pannepyo. If the answer is ambiguous...
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,455
We're going to search it right away.
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:55,100
[It's not fair]
But this is too fast.
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,250
[Coochie coochie coo]
Was it too fast?
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,795
- It's supposed to...
- It should be this fast.
00:06:57,795 --> 00:07:01,945
It gets faster and slower.
00:07:02,805 --> 00:07:04,720
- I will adjust the speed.
- OK.
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,475
The first letter is Bang.
00:07:08,475 --> 00:07:11,960
Starting with Jungkook.
From right to left.
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,105
[Bang?]
The starting letter is Bang?
00:07:13,105 --> 00:07:15,350
[I got an idea]
- There's the only answer. - It's hard.
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:16,655
[Get ready]
Get ready for it, Jimin.
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:19,420
[Excited]
- Here we go. - I have no idea, but let's start.
00:07:21,445 --> 00:07:22,580
It's fast.
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,555
Kung Kung Ta.
00:07:23,555 --> 00:07:25,110
[Suga looks particularly cheerful today]
Kung Kung Ta. Kung Kung Ta.
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:26,192
Kung Kung Ta. Kung Kung Ta.
00:07:26,192 --> 00:07:29,080
- Kung Kung Kung.

Kung Kung Kung Kung.
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,780
Bang Sihyuk.

Hyukgi hyung.
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,885
[Crack up]
I know Hyukgi hyung.
00:07:36,885 --> 00:07:37,715
[Are you watching, Hyukgi?]
[Unexpectedly mentioning an employee]
00:07:37,715 --> 00:07:39,076
[He can't do that]
It's someone we know.
00:07:39,076 --> 00:07:42,127
[MC Suga sets the rules]
He does exist, so let's proceed.
00:07:42,127 --> 00:07:43,672
Hyukgi hyung.
Kung Kung Ta.
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:45,222
Hyungaya (Big brother).
00:07:45,222 --> 00:07:47,720
[Did you call me?] [Rolling on the floor]
- Hyungaya? - That makes sense.
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,942
[Adamant]
Please look it up.
00:07:48,942 --> 00:07:50,347
- Hyungaya.
- Hang on. Hyukgi hyung counts?
00:07:50,347 --> 00:07:53,147
[Trying to defend himself] - Hyukgi hyung counts.
- It is okay, because he's a real person.
00:07:53,147 --> 00:07:55,677
[Adding more rules]
- It should be someone we know. - Right.
00:07:55,677 --> 00:07:57,200
[Rumble]
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,550
[Stop fighting... guys...]
- Even Bang Sihyuk works. - He's a public figure.
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,060
Why can't Hyukgi hyung work?
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,945
[Objection to the crew]
- Would you let "Hyungaya" slide?
- Hyukgi hyung worked.
00:08:02,945 --> 00:08:05,055
Hyukgi hyung shouldn't count.
It would be endless.
00:08:05,055 --> 00:08:07,460
[The MC's word is law]
It just has to be someone we all know.
00:08:08,826 --> 00:08:11,291
A movie or book titled "Hyungaya".
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,541
- There's nothing?
- Books or films.
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:16,041
[The crew searched, but there's no such thing]
- All right. - Then we lost?
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,171
- Then you lost.
- So you earn 1 point?
00:08:17,171 --> 00:08:18,621
[The gain of a third party] [Team Kim Seokjin
earns 1 point] 1 point!
00:08:18,621 --> 00:08:20,251
- Pull yourself together!
- Let's move on.
00:08:20,251 --> 00:08:22,211
[Current score] [Glasses 2 : Kim Seokjin 1]
The current score is 2:1.
00:08:22,211 --> 00:08:24,111
You can change seats.
00:08:24,111 --> 00:08:25,376
- You can trade your seats?
- Seats?
00:08:25,376 --> 00:08:26,646
[RM and V changed their seats]
Come over here, Taehyung.
00:08:26,646 --> 00:08:28,447
[Patronizing]
Let's not allow names.
00:08:28,447 --> 00:08:30,690
[Not fair] - OK. No names.
- Then it'd be too difficult.
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:32,984
- No names.
- Not our friends' name.
00:08:32,984 --> 00:08:33,920
[Come on... You change the rules now?]
No names from now on?
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,947
[Let's count a public figure as the answer]
Everyone knows Bang Sihyuk.
00:08:35,947 --> 00:08:38,524
[Our CEO]
- He's more famous than me. - Right.
00:08:38,524 --> 00:08:41,754
Now starting with Taehyung.
You're going from right to left.
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:44,740
- I'm nervous.
- The starting letter is "So".
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,415
- So?
- Here we go.

[Oh yeah!]

What did you say?
00:09:13,411 --> 00:09:15,430
Giyeopyo.
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,595
- That's not a word.
- Giyeopyo?
00:09:17,595 --> 00:09:19,440
[What does that mean?]
Giyeopyo? A ticket to make a donation?
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,245
That is not a word.
00:09:21,245 --> 00:09:22,825
No!
00:09:22,825 --> 00:09:24,535
[Obviously...]
I'm sorry, guys.
00:09:24,535 --> 00:09:25,945
This is why we should start slowly.
00:09:25,945 --> 00:09:27,265
[Self-contempt?]
We're terrible at this.
00:09:27,265 --> 00:09:28,492
The victory goes to Team Glasses.

[Too fast, panicky]
I can't do it, because I'm flustered.

Let's start with a letter "Tan".
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,840
Starting with J-Hope. To your left.
The starting letter is "Tan".
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,606
[Spaced out] - Give him some time to think.
- I'm not sure if I can use this word.
00:09:37,606 --> 00:09:40,106
- Let's give it a try. - Tell me.
- There's a word starting with "Tan".
00:09:40,106 --> 00:09:41,550
[Whisper]
- Tan is easy. - There are lots of words.
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:43,620
- So many words starting with "Tan".
- You know that word.
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,150
[Jimin is puzzled]
- There are a lot? - Of course.
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,510
[Even I know some!]
There should be some words.
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:47,865
Please go ahead.
00:09:47,865 --> 00:09:50,731
- Dandan noodles. - Tansansu (sparkling water).
- Tansansu. - There are so many words.

- Nice. - Bang Sihyuk is worth a try.
00:10:22,295 --> 00:10:24,380
- Thank you, sir!
- No more "Bang".
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,750
[RM's another objection]
Think of a 3-letter word starting with Bang.

[I'm proud of you]
Hyukgeose.
00:10:29,182 --> 00:10:32,811
- Good idea. - Why did you say that?
You should have kept it a secret.

[From me?] - It's getting faster.
- From RM, go to your left.
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:39,837
- From RM. - Let's start slowly.
- The next letter is "Si".

- It's correct. - How come?

and listen to a children's song]
00:13:04,194 --> 00:13:06,040
[Get some sleep for 30 minutes
and wake up to start the game right away!]
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,910
[RM is already worried about the penalty]
My airport outfits depend on this game?
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,260
Now please lie down on the bed.
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,245
[Time to get some sleep]
Except that bed.
00:13:13,154 --> 00:13:15,179
[What is this thing?]
00:13:18,235 --> 00:13:20,285
[BTS makes a fuss even when they lie down]
- It's so comfy. - I can really sleep on this.
00:13:20,285 --> 00:13:22,985
- I thought I couldn't sleep, but with this,
I think I will. - I can't help but fall asleep.
00:13:22,985 --> 00:13:24,335
This is nice.
00:13:24,335 --> 00:13:26,283
- It's so comfy.
- What is this thing?
00:13:26,715 --> 00:13:28,175
[Curious]
Are you going to sleep, MC Suga?
00:13:28,175 --> 00:13:30,455
[Sure thing]
I will go to sleep.
00:13:31,405 --> 00:13:32,640
Is the MC going to sleep as well?
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,519
[Distant memory] - The MC was supposed to stay
awake in the original show. - I'll wake you up.
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,670
I will go to sleep together
and wake up early to wake you up.
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:40,300
[Satisfied]
- This is so comfy. - This is...
00:13:40,845 --> 00:13:42,105
Unbelievable.
00:13:42,425 --> 00:13:44,255
[BTS lied down]
Are you ready?
00:13:44,255 --> 00:13:47,010
[Jungkook is already asleep?]
Jungkook is already asleep.
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:48,145
Are you sleeping already, Jungkook?
00:13:48,145 --> 00:13:50,683
- Jungkook. Listen to the music.
- He fell asleep.
00:13:50,683 --> 00:13:52,995
Music, please.
00:13:52,995 --> 00:13:55,980
[Amazing Tomato]
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:56,830
[What is this?]
00:14:00,433 --> 00:14:07,760
"Big and plump, a healthy body
with a red costume"
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,752
[You're not asleep, are you, Jimin?]
"Sweet and sour, yummy smelling"
00:14:11,752 --> 00:14:15,235
[Mumble]
"Amazing tomato (tomato)"
00:14:15,235 --> 00:14:19,013
"I'll be a tasty glass of juice (gulp)"
00:14:19,013 --> 00:14:22,730
"I will be yummy ketchup (squirt)"
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:26,490
"I will dance wiggle and jiggle (hey)"
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:30,320
[Focused]
"A showy tomato (tomato)"
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,420
- I forgot already.
- Be quiet.
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:36,875
[Good night] - I don't know.
- See you in a bit. - Let's just sleep.
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,255
I don't know.
00:14:39,252 --> 00:14:41,115
[Whining]
I forgot already.
00:14:41,115 --> 00:14:43,825
[Why are you so serious...]
- I really forgot. - Be quiet. Hush.
00:14:43,825 --> 00:14:46,454
[Warning]
I'll deduct 1 point if you speak from now on.
00:14:49,857 --> 00:14:51,720
[Let's sleep, Jungkook]
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,776
You're humming, Jungkook.
I can deduct 1 point.
00:14:55,405 --> 00:14:58,424
[They quietly fall asleep]
00:14:59,504 --> 00:15:01,396
[15 minutes later...]
00:15:06,152 --> 00:15:10,092
[BTS is sleeping well, wiggling around]
00:15:10,092 --> 00:15:12,686
[Jimin is completely still]
00:15:13,994 --> 00:15:15,836
[Fast asleep]
00:15:17,307 --> 00:15:22,051
[Next to MC Suga is...]
00:15:22,051 --> 00:15:24,510
[Jungkook who is fast asleep]
00:15:25,755 --> 00:15:30,260
[You all must have been tired?]
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:33,030
[The members are sleeping well]
00:15:33,785 --> 00:15:35,730
[Wiggle wiggle]
00:15:41,995 --> 00:15:43,987
[Jungkook who was tossing and turning]
00:15:50,335 --> 00:15:52,709
[Suga wakes up and looks around]
00:15:56,057 --> 00:15:58,052
[Jungkook is wiggling around]
00:15:59,974 --> 00:16:03,337
[Suga is laughing at Jungkook who rolled off]
[That's so funny]
00:16:05,156 --> 00:16:07,321
[Jungkook, get back on top]
00:16:08,234 --> 00:16:10,256
[What's he doing?]
00:16:13,117 --> 00:16:15,677
[Everyone is sleeping well like nothing happened]
[Except for him]
00:16:17,944 --> 00:16:19,433
[30 minutes later...]
00:16:22,161 --> 00:16:23,432
[Shall we wake them?]
00:16:23,432 --> 00:16:25,990
[Time for the members to get up]
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:28,329
[Jimin is fast asleep]
00:16:29,074 --> 00:16:30,425
[Wake up]
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,000
[What?]
It's time to get up.
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:37,050
It's time to get up everyone.
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:41,380
[Suga sounds the siren in Jungkook's ear]
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,310
What? What?
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,100
[RM gets up first and waits]
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,536
[Jungkook is still half asleep]
It's time to get up.
00:16:51,145 --> 00:16:53,530
[Where am I? Who am I?]
What do we do now?
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:54,970
[The members start gathering around]
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:59,180
You must start playing the game
right away.
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,030
Are you all awake?
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,765
Did you sleep well? Please sit down.
00:17:02,765 --> 00:17:05,150
[V is testing the mike]
Is it you?
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,975
[Jungkook slept so well]
- Jungkook is almost... - Jungkook!
00:17:06,975 --> 00:17:09,100
[It's time to get up now Jungkook...]
Give up.
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,840
[First person to try]
Please sing the song.
00:17:15,485 --> 00:17:16,990
Ha!
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:20,601
[Wrong!]
- Chupa Chups? - Next.
00:17:20,601 --> 00:17:22,831
Please sit in one line.
00:17:22,831 --> 00:17:26,966
[Suga is giving them advice] Listen carefully to
what the people in front of you sing.
00:17:26,966 --> 00:17:30,071
[Jin is the second player] [Looks around]
Please start.
00:17:33,161 --> 00:17:36,521
- That's not it.
- That makes no sense at all.
00:17:36,521 --> 00:17:38,239
[RM is the third person to try]
00:17:43,185 --> 00:17:48,040
No, you have to at least try to sing the
right notes.
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,090
[RM expression looks happier]
00:17:54,476 --> 00:17:56,416
[Someone steals the attention in the back]
00:17:57,985 --> 00:17:59,720
[Wrong!]
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,460
[There's many people in line to play]
The correct lyrics must be "smell".
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:04,750
- He's sleeping over there. He's still asleep.
- Just let him be.
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,910
[He's famous for not getting up]
He's amazing.
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:08,655
[Please let me sleep some more]
[Blank~]
00:18:08,655 --> 00:18:11,985
[4th one to play, J-Hope]
5, 6, 5, 6, 7, 8.
00:18:11,985 --> 00:18:14,980
[Was this song an R&B?]
Wrong.
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,695
[Tempo was different~ Strict rules!][J-Hope
doesn't know why] - Go. - The tempo. - What?
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:18,795
[Give the mike to me~] - The tempo was
different. - Are you close to the tempo?
00:18:18,857 --> 00:18:22,862
Yes, it has to be faster.
5, 6, 5, 6, 7, 8.
00:18:26,043 --> 00:18:28,438
[Wow~ He's pretty good!]
00:18:28,438 --> 00:18:31,118
[So cute]
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:35,230
[RM is singing in the background]
00:18:36,175 --> 00:18:38,455
OK.
00:18:38,455 --> 00:18:40,675
[Wrong!] [What am I doing here?]
00:18:40,675 --> 00:18:42,475
- Do you know the lyrics? - No~
- He doesn't know at all.
00:18:42,475 --> 00:18:45,840
Everyone, please wake that member up.
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,165
[Discussing] - Right now... - I don't know.
But is that important? I'm slow enough already.
00:18:49,165 --> 00:18:51,735
- Sing it in my ear.
- Please tell us the moment we're wrong.
00:18:51,735 --> 00:18:56,110
[J-Hope is singing in his ear like an angel]
- What are you doing? - 5, 6, 5, 6, 7, 8.
00:19:00,465 --> 00:19:02,805
[What's he doing?]
- Red. - Next.
00:19:06,085 --> 00:19:08,790
[There we go]
00:19:11,635 --> 00:19:13,945
The tempo is a little...
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:19,570
[Sexy tone]
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:21,430
[He raises an objection]
Isn't he a little off? Wrong.
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:24,970
No the notes...
It sounded like you don't know the song at all.
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:28,290
5, 6, 5, 6, 7, 8.
00:19:30,095 --> 00:19:31,690
Tomato!
00:19:34,065 --> 00:19:35,705
[Suga is getting ready to enjoy himself]
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:39,685
- Ketchup, ketchup.
- Wrong.
00:19:39,685 --> 00:19:41,680
[Suga was enjoying himself so much
he didn't even realize there was a mistake]
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,625
- Everyone, you have to do this too.
- What? - What?
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:47,510
[Like this?]
Doubling~ Tomato~
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:54,070
[The members are listening carefully]
Gguk~
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:01,360
[The children's song sounds so sad...]
00:20:02,255 --> 00:20:03,795
Juice.
00:20:03,795 --> 00:20:06,970
- No?
- What's up with you?
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:09,455
[The members are so confused]
Isn't it "Juice~ Ketchup"?
00:20:09,455 --> 00:20:11,260
I'll give you a hint. Sit down.
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,835
[Huh?] [What is he saying?]
"Juice" is the hint. 5, 6.
00:20:13,835 --> 00:20:15,780
5, 6, 7, 8.
00:20:22,005 --> 00:20:24,185
Juice!
00:20:24,185 --> 00:20:26,560
- Just because you sing it loudly doesn't
make it right. - No, wait.
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,225
[J-Hope even made half asleep Jimin laugh]
Please wake Jungkook up.
00:20:28,225 --> 00:20:30,295
Jungkook~
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:32,035
[A complete mess]
Jimin, get in line.
00:20:32,035 --> 00:20:34,280
[I'm so sleepy] - Jungkook! - We don't know
either. We're just giving it a shot.
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:37,640
[Shall I get up now?]
- Get up. - Are you awake Jungkook?
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:42,215
[Nods] [All doing separate things]
5, 6, 5, 6, 7, 8.
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:48,245
[What is it?] You shouldn't have made a mistake
there. Do you want to go first?
00:20:48,245 --> 00:20:50,325
- I want to go first.
- You go first.
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:53,586
Jungkook, that's not the way to the restroom.
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:56,086
[I know]
Jungkook, that's not the restroom.
00:20:56,086 --> 00:20:58,951
5, 6, 5, 6, 7, 8.
00:20:58,951 --> 00:21:01,256
[Dancing]
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:08,812
It was wrong? That wasn't it?
00:21:12,985 --> 00:21:15,765
[Looking unsure of himself]
Ketchup~
00:21:15,765 --> 00:21:17,645
[Jin is going nuts and the members in
line want to look in front of him]
00:21:17,645 --> 00:21:19,625
I'm going nuts.
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:23,463
[What kind of singing is that?]
Please sing the correct notes.
00:21:23,463 --> 00:21:25,283
[He's a funny fellow]
- No... - The notes...
00:21:25,283 --> 00:21:29,823
[MC allows him another chance]
5, 6, 5, 6, 7, 8.
00:21:38,775 --> 00:21:40,835
[Jimin finally got up]
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,620
[Moving up and down]
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,300
Jjak.
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,320
[Finally, Jimin's first try]
Finally the first try.
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,495
5, 6, 7, 8.
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,560
[So sleepy]
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:08,450
[Scratches]
00:22:11,495 --> 00:22:13,260
[Eyes only half open]
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:17,904
You don't gulp down ketchup.
00:22:17,908 --> 00:22:19,953
[The other members cheer him on]
- Good job. - Good job. Great. - 5, 6...
00:22:19,953 --> 00:22:23,538
[The tempo is raised]
I'm going to raise the tempo now. 5, 6, 5, 6, 7, 8.
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:27,269
[Up and down]
00:22:29,615 --> 00:22:31,075
[You're not angry, are you?]
00:22:31,075 --> 00:22:33,890
[What?] [Blank...]
- I'll be yummy ketchup. - What?
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:36,025
[Suga is giving him a hint]
What brand is famous for ketchup?
00:22:36,025 --> 00:22:38,925
[Confused]
5, 6, 5, 6, 7, 8.
00:22:46,855 --> 00:22:48,150
Chop!
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:50,385
[Jimin disappears a lot today]
That was wrong?
00:22:51,383 --> 00:22:53,798
[Confused] - What brand is famous for
ketchup? - Where brand is famous for ketchup?
00:22:53,848 --> 00:22:55,583
[You don't know?]
Ottogi~
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:59,553
[Ottogi? Ottogi?]
5, 6, 5, 6, 7, 8.
00:22:59,553 --> 00:23:01,473
[RM is cute when he sings]
00:23:05,705 --> 00:23:07,435
Ottogi.
00:23:07,435 --> 00:23:09,670
[Did you believe it?]
Ottogi?
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:11,880
Did you believe it?
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,345
- You said Ottogi~
- I was going to try that.
00:23:14,345 --> 00:23:16,980
[Suga is giving them a real hint] Here's a hint.
It feels like you haven't got a clue.
00:23:17,404 --> 00:23:19,324
Jjwak was close.
00:23:19,324 --> 00:23:22,064
[Jimin steps up after hearing the hint!]
5, 6, 5, 6, 7, 8.
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:28,885
[Looks around]
00:23:28,885 --> 00:23:30,835
[He thinks it's funny too]
What?
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,155
- Jook.
- That's not it.
00:23:33,155 --> 00:23:35,135
[Wrong!]
- It's so hard. - It's similar to what?
00:23:38,515 --> 00:23:40,275
[J-Hope went before]
00:23:40,275 --> 00:23:42,450
It's one syllable.
Here we go.
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:45,365
[That's the hint?]
5, 6, 5, 6, 7, 8.
00:23:45,365 --> 00:23:47,440
[Jungkook looks confused]
It's your first try isn't it?
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:50,490
[His first try!]
Sit down please.

[He doesn't care]
00:24:06,088 --> 00:24:07,568
[Good job]
00:24:08,175 --> 00:24:09,930
[Jungkook sings well even though he just got up]
00:24:11,706 --> 00:24:13,626
[He's doing so well~]
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,080
- Isn't it your first try today?
- Yes it is.
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:19,720
Do you remember sleeping even though
you fell off earlier?
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,935
[Just a few minutes ago... Sleeping time]
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:30,250
- You don't remember do you? - I rolled off?
- You suddenly rolled off right next to me.
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:32,630
And then you sighed, "Ah",
and went back to sleep.
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:36,005
[Looks aloof as if it's not about him]
5, 6, 5, 6, 7, 8!

"I will be yummy ketchup, jjak"!
00:24:43,385 --> 00:24:44,990
[Suga is having so much fun]
- That's not it? - Jjak.
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:46,110
[Just in case it's right]
Jjak, jjak!
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,600
[J-Hope is trying his best]
It's not "jjwak", it's jjak!
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,191
[He thinks the youngest is hilarious]

Argh!
00:25:00,145 --> 00:25:01,590
[He's just doing his job]
What? Why are you angry at me?
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:03,135
I did nothing wrong.
00:25:04,135 --> 00:25:06,405
5, 6, 5, 6, 7, 8!
00:25:06,405 --> 00:25:08,670

- I lost. I'm done.

00:25:12,027 --> 00:25:14,291
[Acting cute]
"Sweet and sour, yummy smelling"
00:25:14,291 --> 00:25:15,612
[Excited MC]
OK! OK!
00:25:15,612 --> 00:25:18,112

00:25:26,787 --> 00:25:30,900
[Wrong] [Upset] [V messed up because
Suga was so excited] Please be quiet.
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:34,200
Me? Why? I'm having so much fun.

00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:51,635
[Go]
There's more?
00:25:51,635 --> 00:25:53,395
[The members are tired of the doubling]
- That doubling... - There's more to it?
00:25:53,395 --> 00:25:57,095
"I will dance wiggle and jiggle, dance".
00:25:57,095 --> 00:26:00,275
[RM is dancing to the beat]

That wasn't it?

[Up and down]

"I will dance wiggle and jiggle, hey".
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,970
"Amazing Tomato".
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:24,555
[Jungkook's singing is making
Team Kim Seokjin excited]
00:26:24,555 --> 00:26:26,110
[We're almost there]
We're almost there!
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:27,758
[Whispers] - We're almost there.
- Let's do this. - Are you ready?
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,545
[Suga gives J-Hope the chance to do a winner's
ceremony] Do a winner's ceremony.
00:26:29,545 --> 00:26:31,980
- Let's get it.
- 5, 6, 7, 8!
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,870

"Ugly tomato".
00:26:43,135 --> 00:26:44,425
[J-Hope is bewildered. I said hey!]
Hey.
00:26:44,425 --> 00:26:46,509
[Next] - You were right until "hey".
- It must not be "ugly".
00:26:46,509 --> 00:26:49,884
"I will dance wiggle and jiggle, hey!
My friend..."
00:26:49,884 --> 00:26:51,704
Why are you saying "my friend"?
00:26:51,704 --> 00:26:55,996
- "Dreamy tomato".
- "Yummy tomato". - "Funny tomato".
00:26:55,996 --> 00:26:58,874
[Everyone is making mistakes]
00:26:58,874 --> 00:27:00,381
[So handsome]
00:27:00,381 --> 00:27:02,081
[Everything but the answer]
We already sang everything.
00:27:02,081 --> 00:27:04,991
[The members have no clue]
[Big hint] For example... Stylish...?
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,195
[The members are discussing]
5, 6, 5, 6, 7, 8!
00:27:09,195 --> 00:27:12,755

Good work everyone.

[Today's master of reaction]
00:27:18,835 --> 00:27:21,245
- "Amazing Tomato, tomato".
- Let's go! - It's over!
00:27:21,245 --> 00:27:23,765
[They think they have it in the bag]
00:27:23,765 --> 00:27:26,665
[RM and Jungkook are excited in the back]
"I will be yummy ketchup, squirt".
00:27:26,665 --> 00:27:29,445
"I will dance wiggle and jiggle, hey".
00:27:29,445 --> 00:27:32,085
[2 teams look completely different]
"A showy tomato".
00:27:32,235 --> 00:27:34,980
[We're almost there]
"A showy tomato".
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:39,520
[Correct!] [Unhappy and happy]
That's why we kept hearing "ugly".
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,800
[They finally get the answer]
I heard "ugly".
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:45,085
[I'm so excited]
It was "a showy tomato".
00:27:45,415 --> 00:27:47,425
[V helped lead his team to victory]
We thought it was "yummy".
00:27:47,425 --> 00:27:48,410
[J-Hope is still in shock]
We were talking about
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:50,345
[V is still doing his winner's ceremony]
"yummy" as the answer.
00:27:52,205 --> 00:27:54,290
[V is still dancing]
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:57,055
[The final score being 4:3, Glasses team won]
Glasses team wins.
00:27:57,055 --> 00:27:58,355
[V is so excited he doesn't have to do
any penalties]
00:27:58,355 --> 00:28:01,040
The losers, team Kim Seokjin must wear what they
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:05,220
[Wing's Tour] [Blank~] [Going blank] wore today
when we leave for Macao. - For Macao...
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,265
Yes, when we leave for Macao.
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:11,685
[MC Suga did a great job today]
And I, MC Min YoonGi,
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:14,810
- really tried my best today.
- We know.
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:16,975
- He tried his best. - I really did.
- He's the hero of today.
00:28:16,975 --> 00:28:18,015
[Will J-Hope be right?]
I don't think he picked Team Kim Seokjin.
00:28:18,015 --> 00:28:20,790
[Going over the rules once more]
If I picked Team Kim Seokjin earlier,
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:24,770
- I have to wear the retro style fashion when
we leave. - That's right.
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:26,415
- If I picked the Glasses team...
- Then you can wear
00:28:26,415 --> 00:28:27,305
black clothes that you want.
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,630
[Will Suga be able to pick his clothes?]
I just want to wear something comfortable.
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:31,505
[V is cheering Suga up] - I'd cover my face and
wear a mask... - Yes. - You're wearing glasses.
00:28:31,505 --> 00:28:33,620
[Suga looks so nervous]
00:28:33,624 --> 00:28:35,971
- Which team did he pick?
- Please sing "Amazing Tomato".
00:28:35,971 --> 00:28:37,561
Today's hero!
00:28:37,561 --> 00:28:43,036
What will happen to Suga?
00:28:43,998 --> 00:28:46,953
[They want to see first]
Shall we look at it first behind him?
00:28:46,953 --> 00:28:49,203
- Shall we? - That's a good idea.
- Yes, let's do that.
00:28:49,203 --> 00:28:52,318
[Shakes his head] - Let's change...
- You can't change...
00:28:52,318 --> 00:28:55,378
[Please give me that] - No, no.
- We'll open it behind you. - Please don't.
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:58,400
[Don't get angry Suga] - I don't know why they're
saying that. - Let's not respond to it.
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:02,055
[Agitated] Please don't play any jokes.
Stick with what I picked earlier.
00:29:02,055 --> 00:29:03,490
[We didn't choose this one. You did]
Don't make any reactions.
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,828
- Don't switch. Everything's on tape.
I have evidence. - Don't look.
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,235
1, 2, 3!
00:29:08,235 --> 00:29:10,140
[MC Suga was lucky]
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:14,095
[Nervous] [J-Hope gives him a chance to switch]
Are you sure you don't want to switch?
00:29:14,095 --> 00:29:15,210
[Confident]
I don't want to switch.
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:16,920
Are you sure?
00:29:17,125 --> 00:29:20,460
[What will happen to MC Suga?]
What will happen to Min Yoongi?
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,765
Glasses team!
00:29:23,037 --> 00:29:26,044
I have so much experience with
this kind of program.
00:29:26,044 --> 00:29:28,969
[He isn't nervous anymore, a confident
Suga returns] I saw straight through you all.
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:32,600
[Lucky MC Suga gets ready to say goodbye]
Anyways! Today's Run BTS was
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:36,215
probably the most fun and exciting
show we've ever done.
00:29:36,215 --> 00:29:37,720
[It looked that way]
You seemed to have a great time.
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:40,270
[He had fun making fun of the members]
- I had the most fun. - Please do the closing.
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:42,940
[Sweet smile]
Run BTS will continue.
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:45,640
Run BTS!
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:49,572
[Bye~] Please wear what you wore today
when we leave for Macao tomorrow.

[Team Kim Seokjin is doing their penalty]
[Wing's Tour, leaving for Macao]
00:29:54,312 --> 00:30:01,968
[Lucky Suga, RM and J-Hope]
00:30:02,522 --> 00:30:07,103
I wore this....

Come here.
00:30:14,158 --> 00:30:16,133

00:30:20,313 --> 00:30:22,938
[Team Kim Seokjin is taking a group photo]
1, 2, 3!
00:30:23,403 --> 00:30:24,974
[You guys... smile...]
