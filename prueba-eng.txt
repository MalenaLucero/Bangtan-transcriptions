00:00:31,005 --> 00:00:32,395
He's talented.
00:00:32,395 --> 00:00:34,055
He's talented in losing.
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:36,510
You lose so well.
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,485
Kim Seokjin!
00:00:38,485 --> 00:00:39,430
No. 9. Guyyyyyy.
00:00:41,297 --> 00:00:43,165
Correct.
00:00:43,165 --> 00:00:45,865
I see your strong will not to wear these outfits to the airport.
00:00:45,865 --> 00:00:46,763
Never.
00:00:47,512 --> 00:00:48,617
Have you heard of this?
00:00:48,617 --> 00:00:50,760
- Steel delivery bag game. - Steel delivery bag?
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,570
- What's that? - Steel delivery bag?
00:00:57,675 --> 00:00:59,820
That brings back old memories.
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,060
I have no idea.
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,450
- We should instantly guess what's in there. - I know this game.
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:05,135
- Are you all set? - I'm ready!
00:01:05,135 --> 00:01:07,325
- I have keen eyesight. - Bring the bag in please.
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:10,736
- One player from each side. - Bring the steel bag in please.
00:01:10,736 --> 00:01:12,025
Why don't you give it a try?
00:01:12,025 --> 00:01:15,113
- Let me open and close it. - Open and close.
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,730
Can you guess it correctly?
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:19,730
Is it difficult?
00:01:21,275 --> 00:01:22,795
I think we can, Suga.
00:01:22,795 --> 00:01:25,445
Good.
00:01:25,445 --> 00:01:26,475
That's easy.
00:01:26,828 --> 00:01:29,567
Now, it will be quicker than the blink of an eye.
00:01:29,941 --> 00:01:31,856
- Is it on? - Get ready.
00:01:31,856 --> 00:01:33,347
Start!
00:01:36,015 --> 00:01:38,188
- What was it? - Glasses.
00:01:38,188 --> 00:01:39,620
Body scrub towel.
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:40,370
Wrong.
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:42,382
- Kim Seokjin. - I only saw the bottom.
00:01:42,382 --> 00:01:43,787
- A pencil. - Wrong.
00:01:43,787 --> 00:01:45,722
All I could see was the bottom section.
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,710
- There's no other section. - Really?
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:48,812
Somebody got pretty close.
00:01:48,812 --> 00:01:50,646
- One of the answers was close. - Taehyung.
00:01:50,646 --> 00:01:52,141
- Ah! - No discussion.
00:01:52,141 --> 00:01:53,985
Glasses. Exfoliating towel.
00:01:53,985 --> 00:01:54,755
Wrong.
00:01:54,755 --> 00:01:55,944
Kim Seokjin.
00:01:55,944 --> 00:01:57,504
- Crayon. - Wrong.
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:59,060
Get ready.
00:02:04,885 --> 00:02:06,540
- That was so quick. - Seriously.
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,230
In the blink of an eye, it was already closed.
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:09,740
- I just heard the noise. - Glasses.
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:12,185
- Chalkboard eraser. - I blinked and just heard the noise. - Wrong.
00:02:12,185 --> 00:02:13,335
One more time.
00:02:13,335 --> 00:02:15,584
Hang on. My eyes get very dry.
00:02:15,584 --> 00:02:17,139
Don't blink.
00:02:17,139 --> 00:02:19,273
Do not blink.
00:02:19,273 --> 00:02:20,460
Get closer.
00:02:22,245 --> 00:02:24,605
I can't see anything.
00:02:26,024 --> 00:02:27,574
- I can't see anything. - Answer.
00:02:27,574 --> 00:02:29,734
- I know. - Answer. - You know the answer?
00:02:29,734 --> 00:02:30,874
Answer!
00:02:31,073 --> 00:02:32,465
3, 2, 1.
00:02:32,465 --> 00:02:34,285
- A mechanical pencil! - Wrong. Here we go.
00:02:38,004 --> 00:02:39,205
My eyes hurt!
00:02:41,945 --> 00:02:42,925
Kim Seokjin!
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:44,200
A towel!
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,475
- No. It's different. - Wrong.
00:02:45,511 --> 00:02:47,425
- That was close. - You know that.
00:02:47,425 --> 00:02:49,374
- You know, Taehyung! - I'm not allowed to answer, right?
00:02:49,374 --> 00:02:51,070
I can't believe you don't know that.
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,660
- Team Glasses. - It's driving me crazy. - Answer.
00:02:54,451 --> 00:02:56,066
A dish washing thingy.
00:02:56,066 --> 00:02:57,189
Wrong.
00:02:57,415 --> 00:02:59,065
Kim Seokjin. A scrubbing pad.
00:02:59,065 --> 00:03:00,940
Correct.
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,815
A scrubbing pad.
00:03:04,815 --> 00:03:08,545
- He didn't remember the word. - It's 1:0.
00:03:08,545 --> 00:03:10,875
What's a dish washing thingy?
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:13,811
Come to the center.
00:03:13,811 --> 00:03:15,940
Watch carefully, Jimin. Keep your eyes open.
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,490
Here we go.
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:19,080
Here we go.
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:20,375
Here we go.
00:03:20,749 --> 00:03:21,964
Here we go.
00:03:21,964 --> 00:03:23,428
- Team Glasses! - Answer.
00:03:23,428 --> 00:03:26,254
- A shoe insole. - Correct.
00:03:26,254 --> 00:03:27,325
Awesome!
00:03:29,085 --> 00:03:30,490
Awesome.
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:32,040
1:1.
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,315
Seokjin and Namjoon have a decisive role.
00:03:37,315 --> 00:03:39,440
- OK. - Next round.
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,160
It's 1:1 now. This is interesting.
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,090
Here we go.
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,000
Keep your eyes wide open. Don't blink.
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,329
Everyone.
00:03:49,894 --> 00:03:51,595
- Kim Seokjin! - Glasses!
00:03:51,595 --> 00:03:53,890
- Answer. - A microphone. - Wrong.
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:55,370
- Glasses. - Answer. - Earphones.
00:03:56,285 --> 00:03:57,340
- Earphones. - Wrong.
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:01,550
- One more time, please. - Hang on, hang on.
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,405
1, 2...
00:04:07,965 --> 00:04:11,570
I'm in the left corner, a complete blind spot.
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:13,255
- That's in my blind spot. - Answer.
00:04:13,255 --> 00:04:15,460
That's what happened to me when I was sitting on the floor.
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,320
- Kim Seokjin. - Answer.
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,724

00:04:18,203 --> 00:04:19,420
- Glasses. - Answer.
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,413

00:04:20,615 --> 00:04:22,230
- Kim Seokjin. - Answer. - A smartphone stand.
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:24,145
- Wrong. - I have no idea.
00:04:24,145 --> 00:04:25,360
- I thought so too. - So did I.
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,410
But this is so...
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:28,555
I saw that, but I don't know what it is.
00:04:28,555 --> 00:04:31,130
You're very familiar with this item.
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:35,145
- I think I know. - So do I. But I can't discuss with Seokjin.
00:04:35,145 --> 00:04:36,835
One more time.
00:04:36,835 --> 00:04:38,655
At this speed.
00:04:38,655 --> 00:04:40,126
- What is it? - Look carefully.
00:04:42,706 --> 00:04:44,013
What is that thing?
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:48,610
There's a black lump in there!
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:49,490
- Kim Seokjin. - Answer.
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,104
- Hi-pass. - Wrong.
00:04:51,104 --> 00:04:53,041
Hi-pass? Come on.
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:54,698
We're very close to this.
00:04:54,698 --> 00:04:56,692
- We're very close to it? - For real...
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,690
Here we go. It's black.
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:06,730
No discussion in the back.
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,700
- Am I dumb? - They might hear you. Here we go.
00:05:09,545 --> 00:05:10,295
Argh!
00:05:10,295 --> 00:05:11,786
What is that?
00:05:11,786 --> 00:05:13,272
Glasses!
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,960
Glasses!
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,176
- Answer. - A mask! - Correct!
00:05:20,716 --> 00:05:22,439
- You didn't say, "Glasses". - He just did.
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:24,278
He said, "Glasses".
00:05:24,278 --> 00:05:26,392
Everyone.
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:29,170
How come you don't know it's a mask?
00:05:30,655 --> 00:05:32,860
- That's a mask? - You should have known better.
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:33,925
Come on.
00:05:33,925 --> 00:05:35,220
It is a mask.
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:38,880
I didn't know what it is, even after I saw that.
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,715
I had no idea even after I saw that for 5 seconds.
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:42,677
- I had no idea either. - It's obviously a mask.
00:05:42,677 --> 00:05:44,472
I guess we'll be wearing these clothes.
00:05:44,472 --> 00:05:48,060
The victory goes to Team Glasses.
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,675
How many games are left?
00:05:49,675 --> 00:05:50,910
There are a plenty of games left.
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:53,258
Don't worry. We have lots of games.
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:57,400
Everyone. The third game is...
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,060
- Kung Kung Ta? - The legendary game?
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:02,863
It's Kung Kung Ta game.
00:06:09,352 --> 00:06:12,920
Shall we start? The starting letter is "Gi". 5, 6, 7, 8.
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,880
Kung Kung Ta. Kung Kung Ta.
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,870
Kung Kung Ta. Kung Kung Ta.
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,375
Kung Kung Kung Kung.
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:21,695
Gijunggi (crane). Kung Kung Ta.
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,950
Gireogi (goose). Kung Kung Ta.
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,275
Kichapyo (Train ticket). Kung Kung Ta.
00:06:24,275 --> 00:06:25,605
Pyojipan (road sign). Kung Kung Ta.
00:06:25,605 --> 00:06:26,995
Pannepyo (?) Kung Kung Ta.
00:06:26,995 --> 00:06:28,257
Pyo Inbong (name of a comedian). Kung Kung Ta.
00:06:28,257 --> 00:06:29,808
Bongseon...
00:06:30,589 --> 00:06:33,697
And you lose.
00:06:33,697 --> 00:06:34,702
That was the pre-game.
00:06:34,702 --> 00:06:36,782
- What a relief. - Right. Bongseonhwa (Garden balsam).
00:06:36,782 --> 00:06:38,277
- Come on. - I thought you'd answer that.
00:06:38,277 --> 00:06:40,282
Like this.
00:06:40,282 --> 00:06:41,142
What did you say?
00:06:41,142 --> 00:06:42,550
Me? Pyojipan (road sign).
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:44,417
- Did you say Pyojipan (road sign)? - Pannepyo.
00:06:44,417 --> 00:06:45,900
Pannepyo?
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,148
What does that even mean?
00:06:47,148 --> 00:06:49,558
- Pannepyo? - Panmepyo (ticket).
00:06:49,558 --> 00:06:52,050
Pannepyo. If the answer is ambiguous...
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,455
We're going to search it right away.
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:55,100
But this is too fast.
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,250
Was it too fast?
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,795
- It's supposed to... - It should be this fast.
00:06:57,795 --> 00:07:01,945
It gets faster and slower.
00:07:02,805 --> 00:07:04,720
- I will adjust the speed. - OK.
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,475
The first letter is Bang.
00:07:08,475 --> 00:07:11,960
Starting with Jungkook. From right to left.
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,105
The starting letter is Bang?
00:07:13,105 --> 00:07:15,350
- There's the only answer. - It's hard.
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:16,655
Get ready for it, Jimin.
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:19,420
- Here we go. - I have no idea, but let's start.
00:07:21,445 --> 00:07:22,580
It's fast.
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,555
Kung Kung Ta.
00:07:23,555 --> 00:07:25,110
Kung Kung Ta. Kung Kung Ta.
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:26,192
Kung Kung Ta. Kung Kung Ta.
00:07:26,192 --> 00:07:29,080
- Kung Kung Kung. - Kung Kung Ta. Kung Kung Ta.
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:29,950
Kung Kung Ta.
00:07:30,181 --> 00:07:31,500
Kung Kung Kung Kung.
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,780
Bang Sihyuk.
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,160
Hyukgi hyung.
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,885
I know Hyukgi hyung.
00:07:37,715 --> 00:07:39,076
It's someone we know.
00:07:39,076 --> 00:07:42,127
He does exist, so let's proceed.
00:07:42,127 --> 00:07:43,672
Hyukgi hyung. Kung Kung Ta.
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:45,222
Hyungaya (Big brother).
00:07:45,222 --> 00:07:47,720
- Hyungaya? - That makes sense.
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,942
Please look it up.
00:07:48,942 --> 00:07:50,347
- Hyungaya. - Hang on. Hyukgi hyung counts?
00:07:50,347 --> 00:07:53,147
- Hyukgi hyung counts. - It is okay, because he's a real person.
00:07:53,147 --> 00:07:55,677
- It should be someone we know. - Right.
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,550
- Even Bang Sihyuk works. - He's a public figure.
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,060
Why can't Hyukgi hyung work?
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,945
- Would you let "Hyungaya" slide? - Hyukgi hyung worked.
00:08:02,945 --> 00:08:05,055
Hyukgi hyung shouldn't count. It would be endless.
00:08:05,055 --> 00:08:07,460
It just has to be someone we all know.
00:08:08,826 --> 00:08:11,291
A movie or book titled "Hyungaya".
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,541
- There's nothing? - Books or films.
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:16,041
- All right. - Then we lost?
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,171
- Then you lost. - So you earn 1 point?
00:08:17,171 --> 00:08:18,621

- No names. - Not our friends' name.
00:08:32,984 --> 00:08:33,920

Everyone knows Bang Sihyuk.
00:08:35,947 --> 00:08:38,524
- He's more famous than me. - Right.
00:08:38,524 --> 00:08:41,754
Now starting with Taehyung. You're going from right to left.
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:44,740

Giyeopyo.
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,595
- That's not a word. - Giyeopyo?

00:09:21,245 --> 00:09:22,825
No!
00:09:22,825 --> 00:09:24,535
I'm sorry, guys.
00:09:24,535 --> 00:09:25,945
This is why we should start slowly.
00:09:25,945 --> 00:09:27,265
We're terrible at this.
00:09:27,265 --> 00:09:28,492
The victory goes to Team Glasses.
00:09:28,492 --> 00:09:30,520
I can't do it, because I'm flustered.
00:09:30,957 --> 00:09:32,550
Let's start with a letter "Tan".
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,840
Starting with J-Hope. To your left. The starting letter is "Tan".
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,606

- Nice. - Bang Sihyuk is worth a try.
00:10:22,295 --> 00:10:24,380
- Thank you, sir! - No more "Bang".
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,750
Think of a 3-letter word starting with Bang.

Hyukgeose.
00:10:29,182 --> 00:10:32,811

- It's correct. - How come?
00:11:20,032 --> 00:11:21,760

- Renaissan? - Wrong.
00:11:54,325 --> 00:11:55,670
Is there a word "Renaissan"?
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:57,000

00:12:09,051 --> 00:12:11,780
- Please check if rock genre makes sense. - Of course it does.
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:15,085
If you do, I will accept the result.
00:12:15,085 --> 00:12:17,560
The noun called rock genre is...
00:12:20,731 --> 00:12:23,438
There is.

I don't understand how we won.
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:45,055
- So the current score is... - It's hard to come up with a 3-letter word.
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:48,290
It's 3:3. So the next game
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:53,005
- will decide the winning team. - I'm tired.
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:55,275

00:13:31,405 --> 00:13:32,640
Is the MC going to sleep as well?
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,519
- The MC was supposed to stay awake in the original show. - I'll wake you up.
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,670

You're humming, Jungkook. I can deduct 1 point.
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,000
It's time to get up.
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:37,050
It's time to get up everyone.
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,310

00:17:33,161 --> 00:17:36,521
- That's not it. - That makes no sense at all.
00:17:43,185 --> 00:17:48,040
No, you have to at least try to sing the right notes.
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,460
The correct lyrics must be "smell".
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:04,750

- The tempo was different. - Are you close to the tempo?
00:18:18,857 --> 00:18:22,862
Yes, it has to be faster. 5, 6, 5, 6, 7, 8.
00:18:36,175 --> 00:18:38,455

Isn't he a little off? Wrong.
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:24,970
No the notes... It sounded like you don't know the song at all.
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:28,290
5, 6, 5, 6, 7, 8.
00:19:30,095 --> 00:19:31,690
Tomato!
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:39,685
- Ketchup, ketchup. - Wrong.
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,625
- Everyone, you have to do this too. - What? - What?
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:47,510
Doubling~ Tomato~
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:54,070
Gguk~
00:20:02,255 --> 00:20:03,795
Juice.
00:20:03,795 --> 00:20:06,970
- No? - What's up with you?
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:09,455
Isn't it "Juice~ Ketchup"?
00:20:09,455 --> 00:20:11,260
I'll give you a hint. Sit down.
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,835
"Juice" is the hint. 5, 6.
00:20:13,835 --> 00:20:15,780
5, 6, 7, 8.
00:20:22,005 --> 00:20:24,185
Juice!
00:20:24,185 --> 00:20:26,560
- Just because you sing it loudly doesn't make it right. - No, wait.
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,225
Please wake Jungkook up.
00:20:28,225 --> 00:20:30,295
Jungkook~
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:32,035
Jimin, get in line.
00:20:32,035 --> 00:20:34,280
- Jungkook! - We don't know either. We're just giving it a shot.
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:37,640
- Get up. - Are you awake Jungkook?
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:42,215
5, 6, 5, 6, 7, 8.
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:48,245
You shouldn't have made a mistake there. Do you want to go first?
00:20:48,245 --> 00:20:50,325
- I want to go first. - You go first.
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:53,586
Jungkook, that's not the way to the restroom.
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:56,086
Jungkook, that's not the restroom.
00:20:56,086 --> 00:20:58,951
5, 6, 5, 6, 7, 8.
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:08,812
It was wrong? That wasn't it?
00:21:12,985 --> 00:21:15,765
Ketchup~
00:21:17,645 --> 00:21:19,625
I'm going nuts.
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:23,463
Please sing the correct notes.
00:21:23,463 --> 00:21:25,283
- No... - The notes...
00:21:25,283 --> 00:21:29,823
5, 6, 5, 6, 7, 8.
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,300
Jjak.
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,320
Finally the first try.
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,495
5, 6, 7, 8.
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:17,904
You don't gulp down ketchup.
00:22:17,908 --> 00:22:19,953
- Good job. - Good job. Great. - 5, 6...
00:22:19,953 --> 00:22:23,538
I'm going to raise the tempo now. 5, 6, 5, 6, 7, 8.
00:22:31,075 --> 00:22:33,890
- I'll be yummy ketchup. - What?
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:36,025
What brand is famous for ketchup?
00:22:36,025 --> 00:22:38,925
5, 6, 5, 6, 7, 8.
00:22:46,855 --> 00:22:48,150
Chop!
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:50,385
That was wrong?
00:22:51,383 --> 00:22:53,798
- What brand is famous for ketchup? - Where brand is famous for ketchup?
00:22:53,848 --> 00:22:55,583
Ottogi~
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:59,553
5, 6, 5, 6, 7, 8.
00:23:05,705 --> 00:23:07,435
Ottogi.
00:23:07,435 --> 00:23:09,670
Ottogi?
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:11,880
Did you believe it?
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,345
- You said Ottogi~ - I was going to try that.
00:23:14,345 --> 00:23:16,980
Here's a hint. It feels like you haven't got a clue.
00:23:17,404 --> 00:23:19,324
Jjwak was close.
00:23:19,324 --> 00:23:22,064
5, 6, 5, 6, 7, 8.
00:23:28,885 --> 00:23:30,835
What?
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,155
- Jook. - That's not it.
00:23:33,155 --> 00:23:35,135
- It's so hard. - It's similar to what?
00:23:40,275 --> 00:23:42,450
It's one syllable. Here we go.
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:45,365
5, 6, 5, 6, 7, 8.
00:23:45,365 --> 00:23:47,440
It's your first try isn't it?
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:50,490
Sit down please.
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:53,365
5, 6, 5, 6, 7, 8.
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,080
- Isn't it your first try today? - Yes it is.
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:19,720
Do you remember sleeping even though you fell off earlier?
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:30,250
- You don't remember do you? - I rolled off? - You suddenly rolled off right next to me.
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:32,630
And then you sighed, "Ah", and went back to sleep.
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:36,005
5, 6, 5, 6, 7, 8!
00:24:36,005 --> 00:24:38,975
"I will be a tasty glass of juice, gulp".
00:24:39,225 --> 00:24:42,670
"I will be yummy ketchup, jjak"!
00:24:43,385 --> 00:24:44,990
- That's not it? - Jjak.
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:46,110
Jjak, jjak!
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,600
It's not "jjwak", it's jjak!
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,191
"I will be a tasty glass of juice, gulp".
00:24:51,191 --> 00:24:54,320
"I will be yummy ketchup, squirt".
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:58,655
"I will dance wiggle and jiggle".
00:24:58,655 --> 00:25:00,145
Argh!
00:25:00,145 --> 00:25:01,590
What? Why are you angry at me?
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:03,135
I did nothing wrong.
00:25:04,135 --> 00:25:06,405
5, 6, 5, 6, 7, 8!
00:25:06,405 --> 00:25:08,670
"Big and plump, a healthy body"
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:11,685
- I lost. I'm done. - "With a red costume"
00:25:12,027 --> 00:25:14,291
"Sweet and sour, yummy smelling"
00:25:14,291 --> 00:25:15,612
OK! OK!
00:25:15,612 --> 00:25:18,112
- "Amazing Tomato, tomato". - Almost there! Let's go!
00:25:18,487 --> 00:25:21,432
"I will be a tasty glass of juice, gulp".
00:25:21,457 --> 00:25:26,787
- "I will be"... Oh, come on. - Come on, come on!
00:25:26,787 --> 00:25:30,900
Please be quiet.
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:34,200
Me? Why? I'm having so much fun.
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,820
5, 6, 5, 6, 7, 8!
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:39,510
- "Amazing Tomato, tomato". - All together! - You can do it!
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:42,790
"I will be a tasty glass of juice, gulp".
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:46,200
- "I will be yummy ketchup, splat"! - Come on!
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:49,000
"I will dance wiggle and jiggle".
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:51,635
There's more?
00:25:51,635 --> 00:25:53,395
- That doubling... - There's more to it?
00:25:53,395 --> 00:25:57,095
"I will dance wiggle and jiggle, dance".
00:25:57,095 --> 00:26:00,275
Yeah!
00:26:00,886 --> 00:26:03,741
That wasn't it?
00:26:03,741 --> 00:26:06,566
- Yay! - "Yay" was what I said.
00:26:06,566 --> 00:26:09,726
Wow!
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,820
Yay~
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:18,715
- "I will dance". - I will dance"~
00:26:18,715 --> 00:26:20,440
"I will dance wiggle and jiggle, hey".
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,970
"Amazing Tomato".
00:26:24,555 --> 00:26:26,110
We're almost there!
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:27,758
- We're almost there. - Let's do this. - Are you ready?
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,545
Do a winner's ceremony.
00:26:29,545 --> 00:26:31,980
- Let's get it. - 5, 6, 7, 8!
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,870
"I will be a tasty glass of juice, gulp".
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:38,005
I will be yummy ketchup, splat".
00:26:38,005 --> 00:26:40,955
"I will dance wiggle and jiggle, hey".
00:26:40,955 --> 00:26:42,765
"Ugly tomato".
00:26:43,135 --> 00:26:44,425
Hey.
00:26:44,425 --> 00:26:46,509
- You were right until "hey". - It must not be "ugly".
00:26:46,509 --> 00:26:49,884
"I will dance wiggle and jiggle, hey! My friend..."
00:26:49,884 --> 00:26:51,704
Why are you saying "my friend"?
00:26:51,704 --> 00:26:55,996
- "Dreamy tomato". - "Yummy tomato". - "Funny tomato".
00:27:00,381 --> 00:27:02,081
We already sang everything.
00:27:02,081 --> 00:27:04,991
For example... Stylish...?
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,195
5, 6, 5, 6, 7, 8!
00:27:09,195 --> 00:27:12,755
We're done!
00:27:13,795 --> 00:27:15,280
Good work everyone.
00:27:18,835 --> 00:27:21,245
- "Amazing Tomato, tomato". - Let's go! - It's over!
00:27:23,765 --> 00:27:26,665
"I will be yummy ketchup, squirt".
00:27:26,665 --> 00:27:29,445
"I will dance wiggle and jiggle, hey".
00:27:29,445 --> 00:27:32,085
"A showy tomato".
00:27:32,235 --> 00:27:34,980
"A showy tomato".
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:39,520
That's why we kept hearing "ugly".
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,800
I heard "ugly".
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:45,085
It was "a showy tomato".
00:27:45,415 --> 00:27:47,425
We thought it was "yummy".
00:27:47,425 --> 00:27:48,410
We were talking about
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:50,345
"yummy" as the answer.
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:57,055
Glasses team wins.
00:27:58,355 --> 00:28:01,040
The losers, team Kim Seokjin must wear what they
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:05,220
wore today when we leave for Macao. - For Macao...
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,265
Yes, when we leave for Macao.
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:11,685
And I, MC Min YoonGi,
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:14,810
- really tried my best today. - We know.
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:16,975
- He tried his best. - I really did. - He's the hero of today.
00:28:16,975 --> 00:28:18,015
I don't think he picked Team Kim Seokjin.
00:28:18,015 --> 00:28:20,790
If I picked Team Kim Seokjin earlier,
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:24,770
- I have to wear the retro style fashion when we leave. - That's right.
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:26,415
- If I picked the Glasses team... - Then you can wear
00:28:26,415 --> 00:28:27,305
black clothes that you want.
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,630
I just want to wear something comfortable.
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:31,505
- I'd cover my face and wear a mask... - Yes. - You're wearing glasses.
00:28:33,624 --> 00:28:35,971
- Which team did he pick? - Please sing "Amazing Tomato".
00:28:35,971 --> 00:28:37,561
Today's hero!
00:28:37,561 --> 00:28:43,036
What will happen to Suga?
00:28:43,998 --> 00:28:46,953
Shall we look at it first behind him?
00:28:46,953 --> 00:28:49,203
- Shall we? - That's a good idea. - Yes, let's do that.
00:28:49,203 --> 00:28:52,318
- Let's change... - You can't change...
00:28:52,318 --> 00:28:55,378
- No, no. - We'll open it behind you. - Please don't.
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:58,400
- I don't know why they're saying that. - Let's not respond to it.
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:02,055
Please don't play any jokes. Stick with what I picked earlier.
00:29:02,055 --> 00:29:03,490
Don't make any reactions.
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,828
- Don't switch. Everything's on tape. I have evidence. - Don't look.
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,235
1, 2, 3!
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:14,095
Are you sure you don't want to switch?
00:29:14,095 --> 00:29:15,210
I don't want to switch.
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:16,920
Are you sure?
00:29:17,125 --> 00:29:20,460
What will happen to Min Yoongi?
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,765
Glasses team!
00:29:23,037 --> 00:29:26,044
I have so much experience with this kind of program.
00:29:26,044 --> 00:29:28,969
I saw straight through you all.
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:32,600
Anyways! Today's Run BTS was
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:36,215
probably the most fun and exciting show we've ever done.
00:29:36,215 --> 00:29:37,720
You seemed to have a great time.
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:40,270
- I had the most fun. - Please do the closing.
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:42,940
Run BTS will continue.
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:45,640
Run BTS!
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:49,572
Please wear what you wore today when we leave for Macao tomorrow.
00:30:02,522 --> 00:30:07,103
I wore this....
00:30:09,301 --> 00:30:10,998
Come here.
00:30:20,313 --> 00:30:22,938
1, 2, 3!
